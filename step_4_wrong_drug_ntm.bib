  abstract = {Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a minimally invasive procedure widely used for the treatment of pain due to vertebral fractures of different origins-osteoporotic, traumatic, or neoplastic. PVP is minimally invasive, but the complications are not rare; however, they are in most cases not significant clinically. The most frequent is cement leakage, which can occur onto veins, paravertebral soft tissue, into the intervertebral disk, or to the spinal canal, affecting foraminal area or epidural space. We analyzed results of treatment and complications of vertebroplasty performed with the use of polimethylomethylacrylate cement (PMMA) on 1100 vertebrae, with a special regard to the severity of complication and eventual clinical manifestation. One thousand one hundred PVP were analyzed, performed in 616 patients. There were 468 (76%) women and 148 men (24%), 24 to 94-year old, mean age 68 years. From 1100 procedures, 794 treated osteporotic and 137 fractures due to malignant disease, 69 PVP were made in traumatic fractures. One hundred patients had painful vertebral hemangiomas. Seven hundred twenty-six (66%) lesions were in thoracic, and 374 (34%) in lumbar area. Results of treatment were assessed using 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 12 hours after surgery, 7 days, 30 days, and then each 6 months, up to 3 years. Before surgery all patients had significant pain 7 to 10 in VAS scale, mean 8.9 cm. Twelve  hours after surgery 602 (97.7%) reported significant relief of pain, with mean VAS of 2,3 cm. Local complications occurred in 50% of osteoporotic, 34% of neoplastic, 16% of traumatic fractures, and 2% of vertebral hemangiomas. The most common was PMMA leakage into surrounding tissues-20%; paravertebral vein embolism-13%; intradiscal leakage-8%; and PMMA leakage into the spinal canal-0.8%. Results of treatment did not differ between patients with and without any complications. From 104 patients who had chest X-ray or CT study performed after surgery, pulmonary embolism was noted in 2 patients, but without any clinical symptoms. Only 1 patient-with PMMA leakage into the spinal canal required surgical decompression In conclusion, PVP is effective in decreasing the level of pain in compression vertebral fractures. Complications occur in almost half of the patients but in more than 95% of them do not produce any clinical symptoms.},

  abstract = {Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have become common surgical techniques for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures. Vertebroplasty involves the percutaneous injection of bone cement into the cancellous bone of a vertebral body with the goals of pain alleviation and preventing further loss of vertebral body height. Kyphoplasty utilizes an inflatable balloon to create a cavity for the cement with the additional potential goals of restoring height and reducing kyphosis. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are effective treatment options for the reduction of pain associated with vertebral body compression fractures. Biomechanical studies demonstrate that kyphoplasty is initially superior for increasing vertebral body height and reducing kyphosis, but these gains are lost with repetitive loading. Complications secondary to extravasation of cement include compression of neural elements and venous embolism. These complications are rare but more common with vertebroplasty. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are both safe and effective procedures for the treatment of vertebral body compression fractures.},

  abstract = {Purpose: 
To compare the technical success and complication rates in CT-guided vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.
Materials and methods: 
From 2002 - 2005 69 patients (101 vertebrae) were treated with vertebroplasty (n = 82) or kyphoplasty (n = 19) using 4-slice MSCT with CT fluoroscopy as the sole guidance for the procedure. The underlying lesions were osteoporotic fractures in 78 vertebral bodies and 23 vertebral metastases.
Results: 
Technical success was achieved in all 101 procedures. Post-interventional CT demonstrated asymptomatic cement leakage in 51/101 vertebrae. Kyphoplasty resulted in leakage in 11/19 (57.9 %) and vertebroplasty in 40/82 (48.8 %) procedures. With p = 0.48 (Mann-Whitney Test) there was no significant difference between kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty with respect to the number of cement leakage occurrences. There was one minor complication of an L5 root irritation following radiofrequency ablation and vertebroplasty of a sarcoma metastasis which subsided without treatment after 8 weeks. There was one major complication of intraspinal cement leakage during tumor vertebroplasty causing T5 root compression and requiring laminectomy for cement removal. The overall rate of major complications requiring treatment was 0.99 %.
Conclusion: 
Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty can be safely performed using only MSCT fluoroscopy guidance. The rate of major complications is very low. There was a high rate of small asymptomatic cement leakages which may have remained undetected with conventional fluoroscopy (CF). There was no statistically significant advantage for kyphoplasty with respect to cement leakage and the technical success rate.},
