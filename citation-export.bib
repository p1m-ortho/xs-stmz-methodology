abstract = {Abstract - Background Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three‐dimensional deformity of the spine . While AIS can progress during growth and cause a surface deformity, it is usually not symptomatic. However, in adulthood, if the final spinal curvature surpasses a certain critical threshold, the risk of health problems and curve progression is increased. The use of scoliosis‐specific exercises (SSE) to reduce progression of AIS and postpone or avoid other more invasive treatments is controversial. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of SSE in adolescent patients with AIS. Search methods The following databases (up to 30 March 2011) were searched with no language limitations: CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2011, issue 2), MEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), CINHAL (from January 1982), SportDiscus (from January 1975), PsycInfo (from January 1887), PEDro (from January 1929). We screened reference lists of articles and also conducted an extensive handsearch of grey literature. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials and prospective cohort studies with a control group comparing exercises with no treatment, other treatment, surgery, and different types of exercises. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Main results Two studies (154 participants) were included. There is low quality evidence from one randomised controlled study that exercises as an adjunctive to other conservative treatments increase the efficacy of these treatments (thoracic curve reduced: mean difference (MD) 9.00, (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.47 to 12.53); lumbar curve reduced:MD 8.00, (95% CI 5.08 to 10.92)). There is very low quality evidence from a prospective controlled cohort study that scoliosis‐specific exercises structured within an exercise programme can reduce brace prescription (risk ratio (RR) 0.24, (95% CI 0.06 to1.04) as compared to usual physiotherapy (many different kinds of general exercises according to the preferences of the single therapists within different facilities). Authors' conclusions There is a lack of high quality evidence to recommend the use of SSE for AIS. One very low quality study suggested that these exercises may be more effective than electrostimulation, traction and postural training to avoid scoliosis progression, but better quality research needs to be conducted before the use of SSE can be recommended in clinical practice. Plain language summary Exercises for scoliosis in teens Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a rare (2% to 3% of the general population) spinal deformity affecting young people aged 10 through the end of the growth period. The deformity may continue into adulthood. AIS is characterised by one or more three‐dimensional spinal curves. Disability, cosmetic deformity, pain, activity limitation, quality of life issues, breathing problems and the possibility of the scoliosis remaining with the person into and throughout adulthood are commonly associated with this condition. The cause of AIS is unknown. Treatment for AIS varies according to the degree of severity of the curves. Just the same, exercise is almost always a part of the treatment plan. In milder cases, exercise may be the main treatment, and in more severe cases it may serve as an adjunct. In the UK and the US, physical therapy for scoliosis consists mainly of general strengthening and stretching exercises, along with exercise protocols with which the treating therapist is familiar. There is a corresponding feeling among practitioners in these geographical locations that physical therapy for scoliosis is not effective. Scoliosis specific exercises (SSEs) are individualised exercises aimed at reducing the deformity. SSEs are taught in clinics that specialize in scoliosis. The exercises work by changing the soft tissue that affects the spine. SSEs are also thought to work by altering control of spinal movement. There are no known side effects or risks to using SSEs . The purpose of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of SSEs in reducing curve progression and postponing or avoiding invasive treatment such as surgery in adolescents with AIS. Two studies involving 154 patients total were included. The review found no evidences for or against SSE. The two included studies yielded very low quality evidence that SSEs added to other treatments are more effective than electrical stimulation, traction and posture training for avoiding curve progression, and that SSEs as a standalone treatment yield almost the same results as general physiotherapy. Possible limitations of this review included the small number of studies that met the inclusion criteria and a high risk of bias, particularly selection bias. More randomised controlled trials are needed in this area, along with a deeper understanding of the types of SSEs useful for the adolescent with AIS.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Idiopathic scoliosis is a three‐dimensional deformity of the spine. The most common form is diagnosed in adolescence. While adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) can progress during growth and cause a surface deformity, it is usually not symptomatic. However, in adulthood, if the final spinal curvature surpasses a certain critical threshold, the risk of health problems and curve progression is increased. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of bracing for adolescents with AIS versus no treatment or other treatments, on quality of life, disability, pulmonary disorders, progression of the curve, and psychological and cosmetic issues. Search methods We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, five other databases, and two trials registers up to February 2015 for relevant clinical trials. We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles and conducted an extensive handsearch of grey literature. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective controlled cohort studies comparing braces with no treatment, other treatment, surgery, and different types of braces for adolescent with AIS. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Main results We included seven studies (662 participants). Five were planned as RCTs and two as prospective controlled trials. One RCT failed completely, another was continued as an observational study, reporting also the results of the participants that had been randomized. There was very low quality evidence from one small RCT (111 participants) that quality of life (QoL) during treatment did not differ significantly between rigid bracing and observation (mean difference (MD) ‐2.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) ‐7.69 to 3.49). There was very low quality evidence from a subgroup of 77 adolescents from one prospective cohort study showing that QoL, back pain, psychological, and cosmetic issues did not differ significantly between rigid bracing and observation in the long term (16 years). Results of the secondary outcomes showed that there was low quality evidence that rigid bracing compared with observation significantly increased the success rate in 20° to 40° curves at two years' follow‐up (one RCT, 116 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.79, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.50). There was low quality evidence that elastic bracing increased the success rate in 15° to 30° curves at three years' follow‐up (one RCT, 47 participants; RR 1.88, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.20). There is very low quality evidence from two prospective cohort studies with a control group that rigid bracing increases the success rate (curves not evolving to 50° or above) at two years' follow‐up (one study, 242 participants; RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.89) and at three years' follow‐up (one study, 240 participants; RR 1.75, 95% CI 1.42 to 2.16). There was very low quality evidence from a prospective cohort study (57 participants) that very rigid bracing increased the success rate (no progression of 5° or more, fusion, or waiting list for fusion) in adolescents with high degree curves (above 45°) (one study, 57 adolescents; RR 1.79, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.07 in the intention‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis). There was low quality evidence from one RCT that a rigid brace was more successful than an elastic brace at curbing curve progression when measured in Cobb degrees in low degree curves (20° to 30°), with no significant differences between the two groups in the subjective perception of daily difficulties associated with wearing the brace (43 girls; risk of success at four years' follow‐up: RR 1.40, 1.03 to 1.89). Finally, there was very low quality evidence from one RCT (12 participants) that a rigid brace with a pad pressure control system is no better than a standard brace in reducing the risk of progression. Only one prospective cohort study (236 participants) assessed adverse events: neither the percentage of adolescents with any adverse event (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.67) nor the percentage of adolescents reporting back pain, the most common adverse event, were different between the groups (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.10). Authors' conclusions Due to the important clinical differences among the studies, it was not possible to perform a meta‐analysis. Two studies showed that bracing did not change QoL during treatment (low quality), and QoL, back pain, and psychological and cosmetic issues in the long term (16 years) (very low quality). All included papers consistently showed that bracing prevented curve progression (secondary outcome). However, due to the strength of evidence (from low to very low quality), further research is very likely to have an impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect. The high rate of failure of RCTs demonstrates the huge difficulties in performing RCTs in a field where parents reject randomization of their children. This challenge may prevent us from seeing increases in the quality of the evidence over time. Other designs need to be implemented and included in future reviews, including 'expertise‐based' trials, prospective controlled cohort studies, prospective studies conducted according to pre‐defined criteria such as the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS) and the international Society on Scoliosis Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Treatment (SOSORT) criteria. Future studies should increase their focus on participant outcomes, adverse effects, methods to increase compliance, and usefulness of physiotherapeutic scoliosis specific exercises added to bracing. Plain language summary Braces for idiopathic scoliosis in adolescents Review question We reviewed the evidence about the effect of bracing on pulmonary disorders (lung diseases), disability, back pain, quality of life, and psychological and cosmetic issues in adolescent with idiopathic scoliosis. We found seven studies. We looked at randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective controlled cohort studies (CCTs). Background Scoliosis is a condition where the spine is curved in three dimensions (from the back the spine appears to be shaped like an 's' and the trunk is deformed). It is often idiopathic, which means the cause is unknown. The most common type of scoliosis is generally discovered around 10 years of age or older, and is defined as a curve that measures at least 10° (called a Cobb angle; measured on x‐ray). Because of the unknown cause and the age of diagnosis, it is called adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). While there are usually no symptoms, the appearance of AIS frequently has a negative impact on adolescents. Increased curvature of the spine can present health risks in adulthood and in older people. Braces are one intervention that may stop further progression of the curve. They generally need to be worn full time, with treatment lasting until the end of growth (most frequently, from a minimum of two to four/five years). However, bracing for this condition is still controversial, and questions remain about how effective it is. Study characteristics This review included seven studies, with a total of 662 adolescents of both genders. AIS from 15° to more than 45° curves were considered. Elastic, rigid (polyethylene), and very rigid (polycarbonate) braces were studied. The evidence is current to October 2013. Funding sources were not reported or external governmental or scientific agencies. Key results We did not find any results on pulmonary disorders and disability. Quality of life was not affected during brace treatment (very low quality evidence); quality of life, back pain, and psychological and cosmetic issues did not change in the long term (very low quality evidence). Rigid bracing seems effective in 20° to 40° curves (low quality evidence), elastic bracing in 15° to 30° curves (low quality evidence), and very rigid bracing in high degree curves above 45° (very low quality evidence); rigid was more successful than an elastic bracing (low quality evidence), and a pad pressure control system did not increase results (very low quality evidence). No specific harms were reported. Primary outcomes such as pulmonary disorders, disability, back pain, psychological and cosmetic issues, and quality of life should be better evaluated in the future. Side effects, as well as the usefulness of exercises and other adjunctive treatments to bracing should be studied too. Quality of the evidence The evidence was moderate to very low quality. Reason for downgrading were evidence coming from few randomized trials with few participants and many lost at follow‐up or from observational prospective controlled studies. An issue in the field of AIS is the high rate of failure of RCTs, since parents want to choose with physicians the preferred treatment for their children. Thus, it is challenging to obtain high quality evidence in this field.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Scoliosis in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is usually progressive and is treated with surgery. However, it is unclear whether the existing evidence is sufficiently scientifically rigorous to support a recommendation for spinal surgery for most patients with DMD and scoliosis. This is an updated review, and an updated search was undertaken in which no new studies were found for inclusion. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of spinal surgery in patients with DMD with scoliosis. We intended to test whether spinal surgery is effective in increasing survival and improving respiratory function, quality of life, and overall functioning, and whether spinal surgery is associated with severe adverse effects. Search methods On 16 June 2015 we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL Plus. We also searched ProQuest Dissertation and Thesis database (January 1980 to June 2015), the National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Database (6 January 2015), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (17 June 2015), and checked references. We imposed no language restrictions. Selection criteria We planned to include controlled clinical trials using random or quasi‐random allocation of treatment evaluating all forms of spinal surgery for scoliosis in patients with DMD in the review. The control interventions would have been no treatment, non‐operative treatment, or a different form of spinal surgery. Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration. Two review authors independently examined the search results and evaluated the study characteristics against inclusion criteria in order to decide which studies to include in the review. Main results Of the 49 relevant studies we found, none met the inclusion criteria for the review because they were not clinical trials, but prospective or retrospective reviews of case series. Authors' conclusions Since no randomized controlled clinical trials were available to evaluate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery in patients with DMD, we can make no good evidence‐based conclusion to guide clinical practice. Patients with scoliosis should be informed as to the uncertainty of benefits and potential risks of surgery for scoliosis. Randomized controlled trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery, in terms of quality of life, functional status, respiratory function, and life expectancy. Plain language summary Surgery for curvature of the spine in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy Review question What is the effectiveness and safety of spinal surgery to treat scoliosis in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)? Background Scoliosis, or curvature of the spine, is common in patients with DMD. It is usually progressive, and surgery is often performed to halt its progression, improve cosmetic appearance, facilitate care, preserve upper limb and respiratory function, and hopefully increase life expectancy. We wished to learn whether spinal surgery was better or worse than the alternatives. Study characteristics We found no randomized controlled trials. Key results and quality of the evidence We found 49 relevant studies, however they were not clinical trials but prospective or retrospective reviews of case series. The quality of evidence was very low because no clinical trial was available. This is an updated review, and an updated search was undertaken in which no new studies were found. Conclusion No randomized controlled clinical trials are available to evaluate the effectiveness of scoliosis surgery in patients with DMD. Randomized controlled clinical trials are needed in this group of patients to evaluate the benefits and risks of different surgical treatments. The evidence is current to 5 January 2015.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2008. Scoliosis surgery is often associated with substantial blood loss and potentially detrimental effects in children. Antifibrinolytic agents are often used to reduce perioperative blood loss. Clinical trials have evaluated their efficacy in children undergoing surgical correction of scoliosis, but no systematic review has been published. This review was first published in 2008 and was updated in 2016. Objectives To assess the efficacy and safety of aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid in reducing blood loss and transfusion requirements in children undergoing surgery for correction of idiopathic or secondary scoliosis. Search methods We ran the search for the previous review in June 2007. For this updated version, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 7), MEDLINE (1946 to August week 1 2015), Embase (1947 to 2015 week 38), Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS) (1982 to 14 August 2015), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE; 2015, Issue 2) and reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles for randomized controlled trials in any language. We also checked the clinical trial registry at  http://www.clinicaltrials.go v on 8 October 2015. Selection criteria We included blinded and unblinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of antifibrinolytics on perioperative blood loss in children 18 years of age or younger and undergoing scoliosis surgery. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted data. The primary outcome was total blood loss (intraoperative and postoperative combined). Secondary efficacy outcomes were the number of participants receiving blood transfusion (both autologous and allogeneic) or receiving allogeneic blood transfusion alone, and the total amount of blood transfused. Safety outcomes included the number of deaths, the number of participants reporting any adverse event or a serious adverse event, withdrawals due to adverse events and the number of participants experiencing a specific adverse event (i.e. renal insufficiency, hypersensitivity or thrombosis). We assessed methodological risk of bias for each included study and employed the GRADE approach to assess the overall quality of the evidence. Main results We included three new studies (201 participants) in this updated review, for a total of nine studies (455 participants). All but one study employed placebo as the control group intervention. For the primary outcome, antifibrinolytic drugs decreased the amount of perioperative blood loss by 427 mL (95% confidence interval (CI) 251 to 603 mL), for a reduction of over 20% versus placebo. We rated the quality of evidence for our primary outcome as low on the basis of unclear risk of bias for several domains in most studies and the small total number of participants. For secondary outcomes, fewer participants receiving antifibrinolytic drugs received transfusion (allogeneic or autologous) versus those receiving placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.85, number needed to treat to prevent one additional harmful outcome (NNTp) 5; very low‐quality evidence). Only two studies specifically evaluated the number of participants transfused with only allogeneic blood (risk difference (RD) ‐0.15, 95% CI ‐0.26 to ‐0.03, NNTp 7; very low‐quality evidence). Antifibrinolytic drugs decreased the volume of blood transfused by 327 mL (95% CI ‐186 to ‐469 mL; low‐quality evidence). No study reported deaths in active or control groups. Data were insufficient to allow performance of meta‐analysis for any safety outcome. No studies adequately described their methods in assessing safety. The only adverse event of note occurred in one study, when three participants in the placebo group developed postoperative deep vein thrombosis. Authors' conclusions Since the last published version of this review (2008), we have found three new studies. Additional evidence shows that antifibrinolytics reduce the requirement for both autologous and allogeneic blood transfusion. Limited evidence of low to very low quality supports the use of antifibrinolytic drugs for reducing blood loss and decreasing the risk, and volume, of transfusion in children undergoing scoliosis surgery. Evidence is insufficient to support the use of a particular agent, although tranexamic acid may be preferred, given its widespread availability. The optimal dose regimen for any of these three agents has not been established. Although adverse events appear to occur infrequently, evidence is insufficient to confirm the safety of these agents, particularly for rare but potentially catastrophic events. No long‐term safety data are available. Plain language summary Antifibrinolytic agents to reduce blood loss in the surgical correction of scoliosis (abnormal curvatures of the spine) in children Background Scoliosis is a curving of the spine beyond that which is normal. Surgery may be needed to correct scoliosis and is often carried out when the child is young. Substantial bleeding may occur during surgery and can lead to serious complications, such as multiple organ failure. Many methods are used to reduce blood loss, including drugs that modify clotting pathways in the body. Medications known as antifibrinolytic drugs can reduce bleeding by preventing the breakdown of a blood clot. This review is an update of a review published in 2008, which looked at how well these drugs work, and how safe they are. Search date This review is an update of a review that we first published in 2008. Our latest search for articles took place in August 2015. Study characteristics The antifibrinolytic drugs evaluated in this systematic review were aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid. We found nine studies that enrolled a total of 455 participants, aged 18 years or younger, who received either antifibrinolytic drugs or a placebo. Total enrolment in each study ranged from 36 participants to 80 participants. Two of the studies evaluated aprotinin, four tranexamic acid and four aminocaproic acid. One study compared aminocaproic acid with tranexamic acid. The other studies administered placebo to the control group. Studies that evaluated aprotinin and aminocaproic acid used high doses (when reported). Of the studies that evaluated tranexamic acid, two used high doses, one used low doses and one did not describe the dose given. Five studies evaluated idiopathic scoliosis (scoliosis with no known cause), and four evaluated both idiopathic scoliosis and scoliosis that occurred as the result of another disease, such as cerebral palsy. Of the nine included studies, five reported how long patients were assessed. Follow‐up ranged from one to 10 days after surgery, or lasted for the participant's length of stay in the hospital. Study funding sources Two studies received grants from organizations of healthcare professionals, and one was sponsored by a pharmaceutical company. The remaining studies did not report sources of funding. Key results Antifibrinolytic drugs reduced the amount of blood lost during, or immediately after, surgery, by 427 millilitres (mL) (more than a 20% reduction in blood loss) and the amount of blood transfused during the same period by 327 mL. The number of children who received transfusions, either through blood from a donor or through a combination of blood from a donor and their own saved blood, was also significantly decreased. We assessed the quality of the evidence for all of these findings as low or very low because of the small numbers of participants, some concerns about study designs and imprecision in study findings. No children included in any studies died, and very few adverse events were reported, although three children receiving placebo in one study developed a clot. However, these studies may not have adequately looked for adverse events, or study authors might not have reported them fully. Also, the number of children evaluated was too small and the time of follow‐up too short to allow review authors to draw any conclusions about their safety. Conclusion This systematic review showed that antifibrinolytic drugs reduce blood loss and decrease the number of children receiving blood transfusions and the amount of blood transfused, but the evidence supporting any of these findings is not very strong. The safety of antifibrinolytic drugs remains unclear.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three‐dimensional deformity of the spine. While AIS can progress during growth and cause a surface deformity, it is usually not symptomatic. However, if the final spinal curvature surpasses a certain critical threshold, the risk of health problems and curve progression is increased. Interventions for the prevention of AIS progression include scoliosis‐specific exercises, bracing, and surgery. The main aims of all types of interventions are to correct the deformity and prevent further deterioration of the curve and to restore trunk asymmetry and balance, while minimising morbidity and pain, allowing return to full function. Surgery is normally recommended for curvatures exceeding 40 to 50 degrees to stop curvature progression with a view to achieving better truncal balance and cosmesis. Short‐term results of the surgical treatment of people with AIS demonstrate the ability of surgery to improve various outcome measures. However there is a clear paucity of information on long‐term follow‐up of surgical treatment of people with AIS. Objectives To examine the impact of surgical versus non‐surgical interventions in people with AIS who have severe curves of over 45 degrees, with a focus on trunk balance, progression of scoliosis, cosmetic issues, quality of life, disability, psychological issues, back pain, and adverse effects, at both the short term (a few months) and the long term (over 20 years). Search methods We searched the Cochrane Back Review Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, four other databases, and three trials registers up to August 2014 with no language limitations. We also checked the reference lists of relevant articles and conducted an extensive handsearch of the grey literature. Selection criteria We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective controlled trials comparing spinal fusion surgery with non‐surgical interventions in people with AIS with a Cobb angle greater than 45 degrees. We were interested in all types of instrumented surgical interventions with fusion that aimed to provide curve correction and spine stabilisation. Data collection and analysis We found no RCTs or prospective controlled trials that met our inclusion criteria. Main results We did not identify any evidence comparing surgical to non‐surgical interventions for AIS with severe curves of over 45 degrees. Authors' conclusions We cannot draw any conclusions. Plain language summary Surgical treatment compared to non‐surgical treatment (braces, exercise, or observation) for teens with idiopathic scoliosis Background Scoliosis is a condition where the spine is curved in three dimensions (from the back the spine appears to be shaped like a 'c' or an 's'). It is often idiopathic, or of unknown cause. The most common type of scoliosis, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), is discovered around 10 years of age or older, and is defined as a curve that measures at least 10 degrees (known as a Cobb angle, which is measured on an x‐ray). People with AIS usually have no symptoms, however the resulting surface deformity frequently negatively impacts adolescents. In addition, increased curvature of the spine can present health risks in adulthood. Different types of treatment, including physical therapy, bracing, and surgery, are advocated depending on the magnitude of the curvature and area affected, truncal balance, general health, level of function and satisfaction, and patient’s and parent’s treatment desire. Surgery is normally recommended in curvatures exceeding 40 to 50 degrees to stop the progression of the curvature. Short‐term results of surgical treatment are improvements on outcome measures relating to self image, some functional aspects, and pain. However, the structured long‐term follow‐up needed to make meaningful conclusions is lacking. Recent papers highlight the long‐term complications of surgery, while other papers postulate that the medium‐ and long‐term complication rates following modern scoliosis surgery are low when compared to older techniques. Study characteristics We searched the literature for both randomised controlled trials and prospective non‐randomised studies with a control group examining the effects of surgical versus non‐surgical treatments for teens with idiopathic scoliosis. The evidence is current to August 2014. Key results We identified no evidence examining the effectiveness of surgical interventions compared to non‐surgical interventions for people with AIS. As a result, we cannot draw any conclusions regarding the benefits or harms of these treatments.},
