  abstract = {Objectives: 
Despite vertebral fractures being a common occurrence in elderly osteoporotic individuals, literature remains scant with regards to 30-day outcomes following vertebral augmentation for these injuries. We studied a national database of elderly osteoporotic patients who underwent vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.
Patients and methods: 
The 2012-2014 ACS-NSQIP database was queried using CPT codes for vertebroplasty (22520, 22521 and 22522) and kyphoplasty (22523, 22524 and 22525). Patients undergoing concurrent spinal fusion and/or laminectomies/laminotomies/laminoplasties were removed from the study. Patients with missing data were also excluded from the study.
Results: 
Following inclusion/exclusion criteria, a total of 2433 patients were included in the study out of which 242(9.9%) underwent vertebroplasty and 2191(90.1%) underwent kyphoplasty. Following adjusted analysis, having a dependent functional health status pre-operatively (OR 1.78; p = 0.010), pre-operative sepsis/SIRS (OR 2.52; p = 0.009), history of COPD (OR 1.62; p = 0.025), disseminated cancer (OR 1.94; p = 0.028), pre-operative wound infection (OR 3.47; p = 0.003) and inpatient admission status (OR 3.22; p < 0.001) were independent predictors of having any complication within 30-days of the procedure. Significant independent risk factors for 30-day mortality were functional health status prior to surgery (OR 2.92; p = 0.002), pre-operative dialysis use (OR 11.74; p = 0.003), Disseminated cancer (OR 7.09; p < 0.001), chronic steroid use (OR 3.59; p < 0.001), and inpatient admission status (OR 4.95; p < 0.001).
Conclusion: 
Vertebroplasty/Kyphoplasty is associated with significant adverse outcomes. Providers can utilize these data to better pre-operatively filter high-risk patients and tailor an appropriate peri-operative medical optimization program to enhance care to lower the risk of complications, readmissions and mortality from this procedure.},

  abstract = {Introduction: 
While evidence supports the efficacy of vertebral augmentation (kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty) for the treatment of osteoporotic fractures, randomized trials disputed the value of vertebroplasty. The aim of this analysis is to determine the subset of patients that may not benefit from surgical intervention and find the optimal intervention time.
Methods: 
27 prospective multiple-arm studies with cohorts of more than 20 patients were included in this meta-analysis. We hereby report the results from the metaregression and subset analysis of those trials reporting on treatment of osteoporotic fractures with kyphoplasty and/or vertebroplasty.
Results: 
Early intervention (first 7 weeks after fracture) yielded more pain relief. However, spontaneous recovery was encountered in hyperacute fractures (less than 2 weeks old). Patients suffering from thoracic fractures or severely deformed vertebrae tended to report inferior results. We also attempted to formulate a treatment algorithm.
Conclusion: 
Intervention in the hyperacute period should not be pursued, while augmentation after 7 weeks yields less consistent results. In cases of thoracic fractures and significant vertebral collapse, surgeons or interventional radiologists may resort earlier to operation and be less conservative, although those parameters need to be addressed in future randomized trials.},

  abstract = {Percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) are minimally invasive procedures performed to stabilize vertebral fractures. With continuing expansion in clinical use, a broad spectrum of complications has been reported for both interventions. The goal of the current study was to compare the safety of these procedures using a questionnaire completed by practitioners. A questionnaire was developed with multiple choice and open questions. General data as well as information regarding complications which occurred during the year 2007 were requested. The incidence and odds ratios (OR) of complications for both procedures were analysed. One hundred and sixteen questionnaires detailing 3216 VP and 5139 BKP procedures were included for evaluation. The risk of cement extrusion from the vertebra (OR 2.64, p <0.01) and into the spinal canal (OR 435, p <0.01) was markedly increased for VP. The odds ratio for neurologic complications (OR 2.56, p = 0.1) and secondary fracture (OR = 0.99, p = 0.96) did not indicate significant predisposition for either procedure. Secondary fracture occurred in 5% of VP and 5.1% of BKP procedures. Overall, 80% of practitioners subjectively considered BKP the safer procedure. Overall, BKP appears safer than VP. Symptomatic complications are rare with both procedures. Additional prospective data is necessary to reach more definitive conclusions.},

As the use of both modalities for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures has increased, so have questions regarding safety and efficacy. The authors addressed this by reviewing both the current literature and complications data reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health through the on-line database (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/maude.html) and through the Office of the Freedom of Information Act at the FDA. Although both procedures are largely safe, the FDA data highlight two main concerns: reactions to the use of acrylic (polymethylmethacrylate) bone cement, including hypotension and, in some cases, death, especially when multiple vertebral levels are treated in one setting; and a possible increased risk with kyphoplasty of pedicle fracture and cord compression.},
