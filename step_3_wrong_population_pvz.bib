Prospective cohort study.
Objective: 
To evaluate, in adults undergoing posterior spinal fusions, 1) the effect of prophylactic vertebroplasty on the incidence of proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) and proximal junctional failure (PJF), and 2) the difference in outcomes between those who did and did not develop PJK or PJF.
Summary of background data: 
Proximal junctional kyphosis occurs in 20% to 39% of adults after posterior spinal fusions; a subset develops PJF.
Methods: 
From 2005 through 2008, we treated 41 consecutive patients (40 years old or more) with spinal deformity with 2-level prophylactic vertebroplasty (at the upper instrumented vertebrae and the supra-adjacent vertebrae) during posterior spinal fusion. The 38 patients with 24 months' follow-up formed our study group. We measured patient outcomes with the Scoliosis Research Society-24 questionnaire, the Oswestry Disability Index, and the 12-item Short Form Survey. All patients completed each assessment preoperatively, and 89% or more did so postoperatively. We compared postoperative and final follow-up radiographs to identify the PJK incidence (ie, a PJK angle change of 10° or more), and analyzed the PJK, PJF, and non-PJK/PJF groups for outcome scores with Student t test and chi-square test (significance, p < .05).
Results: 
Three patients (8%) developed PJK and 2 (5%) developed PJF, markedly lower incidences than those previously reported. At final follow-up, patients with PJK or PJF reported statistically significant lower pain and satisfaction Scoliosis Research Society-24 scores than did patients in the non-PJK/PJF group, but there were no significant differences in Scoliosis Research Society-24 mental health or function scores between groups. All patients had significant improved Oswestry Disability Index and 12-item Short Form Survey scores.
Conclusions: 
Prophylactic vertebroplasty in long posterior spinal fusions for adult spinal deformity resulted in a low incidence of PJF and PJK, with only small differences in outcome scores between those who did and did not develop PJK and PJF.},

  abstract = {Study design: 
An experimental study of cardiovascular complications arising during vertebroplasty (VP) of multiple levels in sheep.
Objectives: 
To investigate the effect of pressurizing vertebral bodies during VP using different materials in the development of fat embolism (FE) and any associated cardiovascular changes.
Summary of background data: 
Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is the material of choice for VP. However, PMMA has several disadvantages, such as toxicity, exothermic curing, uncertain long-term biomechanical effects, and biocompatibility. Alternative materials are being developed for VP; however, there is the concern that an increase in intraosseous pressure and displacement of bone marrow contents could lead to FE and hypotension during VP regardless of what type of materials is used.
Methods: 
In 20 sheep, four vertebral bodies were augmented either with PMMA or bone wax. Heart rate; arterial, central venous, and pulmonary artery pressure; cardiac output; and blood gas values were recorded. Postmortem the lungs were subjected to histologic evaluation.
Results: 
The consecutive augmentation of four vertebral bodies with PMMA induced a cumulative FE that gradually deteriorated baseline mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and blood gas values. The augmentation with bone wax resulted in similar cardiovascular changes and amount of intravascular fat in the lungs.
Conclusion: 
There are potential cardiovascular complications during VP of multiple levels regardless of the augmentation material used. The deteriorating baseline MABP during VP is associated with the pressurization of the vertebral bodies rather than with the use of polymethylmethacrylate.},
