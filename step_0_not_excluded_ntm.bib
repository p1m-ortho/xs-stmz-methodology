  abstract = {Vertebroplasty (VP) and kyphoplasty (KP) have been proven equally effective in providing pain relief in patients with vertebral compression fractures (VCF). Both have been reported to have multiple complications which, though rare, are potentially devastating. This literature review focuses on comparing the incidence of various types of complication of VP and KP. Local cement leakage and pulmonary cement embolism have been reported more commonly after VP than KP. It is questionable whether the relative risk of developing an adjacent level new fracture after VP is greater than after KP The relationship between a new VCF and each of these procedures has also not been clearly established. Although the majority of complications are clinically silent, their potential risks, which include a fatal outcome, should always be kept in mind by the practitioner.},

  abstract = {Purpose: 
To compare complications of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs).
Background: 
PVP and BKP are two minimally invasive procedures for treating OVCFs, while few studies emphases attention to intra- and post-operative complications about the two procedures.
Methods: 
Online databases were searched for studies comparing complications of PVP and BKP for OVCFs, the randomized controlled trials, clinical controlled trials and cohort studies that provided related data were identified. Demographic characteristics and complications related to procedures were extracted and analysed from all of the included studies.
Results: 
Nineteen studies encompassing 1,787 patients in total, of whom 887 received PVP and 900 received BKP, met the inclusion criteria. For subsequent fractures, our meta-analysis detected no significant difference between the two procedures, both for adjacent fractures (p = 0.29) and non-adjacent fractures (p = 0.37). For cement extravasations, there was no significant difference between the two interventions if considering disc spaces extravasations only (p = 0.24), while considering total extravasations and paravertebral extravasations, the cement leakage rate in the PVP group was significantly higher than the BKP group (total: p < 0.01; paravertebral: p < 0.01).
Conclusions: 
The two procedures suffer from equal risk of subsequent spinal fractures; PVP has a significant higher cement leakage rate compared to BKP, mainly caused by a higher paravertebral leakage, patients with extremely poor pulmonary function or unstable haemodynamic are better candidates for BKP.},

  abstract = {Introduction: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) was introduced in 1984 and has proved to be valuable in the treatment of painful vertebral lesions such as haemangiomas, metastasis, and osteoporotic fractures. According to the literature, the operation provides pain relief with only few and harmless complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate our perioperative experiences with special reference to the safety of the procedure.
Material and methods: 
A total of 156 procedures were performed in 148 patients with osteoporotic fractures. Both acute and chronic fractures were treated. All patients had plain radiographs of the spine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or bone scans were performed in case of old fractures or more than one fracture in patients with acute back-pain. At follow-up after three and 12 months, plain radiographs were performed in conjunction with physical examinations and interviews. Data were collected retrospectively.
Results: 
We identified 40.4% cemental leaks (confidence interval (CI) 32.6; 48.5). None of these resulted in neurological symptoms. One patient experienced shortness of breath after the procedure, one had atrial fibrillation, and one patient had an iatrogenic pneumothorax. In all, the frequency of symptomatic complications was 1.9% (CI -0.4; 5.5).
Conclusion: 
We believe that PVP is a safe procedure with only few symptomatic complications when performed under local anaesthesia and by a specialist in transpedicular approach.},
