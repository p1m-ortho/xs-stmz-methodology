abstract = {Abstract - Background People admitted to intensive care units and those with chronic health care problems often require long‐term vascular access. Central venous access devices (CVADs) are used for administering intravenous medications and blood sampling. CVADs are covered with a dressing and secured with an adhesive or adhesive tape to protect them from infection and reduce movement. Dressings are changed when they become soiled with blood or start to come away from the skin. Repeated removal and application of dressings can cause damage to the skin. The skin is an important barrier that protects the body against infection. Less frequent dressing changes may reduce skin damage, but it is unclear whether this practice affects the frequency of catheter‐related infections. Objectives To assess the effect of the frequency of CVAD dressing changes on the incidence of catheter‐related infections and other outcomes including pain and skin damage. Search methods In June 2015 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library) ;  Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL. We also searched clinical trials registries for registered trials. There were no restrictions with respect to language, date of publication or study setting. Selection criteria All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of the frequency of CVAD dressing changes on the incidence of catheter‐related infections on all patients in any healthcare setting. Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane review methodology. Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, performed risk of bias assessment and data extraction. We undertook meta‐analysis where appropriate or otherwise synthesised data descriptively when heterogeneous. Main results We included five RCTs (2277 participants) that compared different frequencies of CVAD dressing changes. The studies were all conducted in Europe and published between 1995 and 2009. Participants were recruited from the intensive care and cancer care departments of one children's and four adult hospitals. The studies used a variety of transparent dressings and compared a longer interval between dressing changes (5 to15 days; intervention) with a shorter interval between changes (2 to 5 days; control). In each study participants were followed up until the CVAD was removed or until discharge from ICU or hospital. Confirmed catheter‐related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) One trial randomised 995 people receiving central venous catheters to a longer or shorter interval between dressing changes and measured CRBSI. It is unclear whether there is a difference in the risk of CRBSI between people having long or short intervals between dressing changes (RR 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 4.98) ( low quality evidence) . Suspected catheter‐related bloodstream infection Two trials randomised a total of 151 participants to longer or shorter dressing intervals and measured suspected CRBSI. It is unclear whether there is a difference in the risk of suspected CRBSI between people having long or short intervals between dressing changes (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.23 to 2.10) ( low quality evidence). All cause mortality Three trials randomised a total of 896 participants to longer or shorter dressing intervals and measured all cause mortality. It is unclear whether there is a difference in the risk of death from any cause between people having long or short intervals between dressing changes (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.25) ( low quality evidence) . Catheter‐site infection Two trials randomised a total of 371 participants to longer or shorter dressing intervals and measured catheter‐site infection. It is unclear whether there is a difference in risk of catheter‐site infection between people having long or short intervals between dressing changes (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.63) ( low quality evidence ). Skin damage One small trial (112 children) and three trials (1475 adults) measured skin damage. There was  very low quality evidence  for the effect of long intervals between dressing changes on skin damage compared with short intervals (children: RR of scoring ≥ 2 on the skin damage scale 0.33, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.68; data for adults not pooled). Pain Two studies involving 193 participants measured pain. It is unclear if there is a difference between long and short interval dressing changes on pain during dressing removal (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.38) ( low quality evidence ). Authors' conclusions The best available evidence is currently inconclusive regarding whether longer intervals between CVAD dressing changes are associated with more or less catheter‐related infection, mortality or pain than shorter intervals. Plain language summary How often should dressings on central venous access devices (CVADs) be changed to reduce catheter‐related infection? Background   A central venous access device (CVAD, also known as a central venous catheter) is a hollow tube that is placed in a large vein with the tip sitting near the heart. CVADs allow medications, fluids and blood products to be given straight into the bloodstream and allow blood samples to be taken for analysis. One of the negative consequences of a CVAD can be an infection of the blood stream which is called catheter‐related bloodstream infection or CRBSI which can be serious and even life‐threatening. Some CVADs can stay in place for weeks, months or years. Most patients admitted to an intensive care unit will have a CVAD inserted and patients with poor veins or requiring long‐term treatment will be offered a CVAD. Dressings are placed over the insertion site of the catheter where it enters the vein, usually in the chest, neck or arm, to protect the surrounding skin. Dressings help prevent infections from starting and they stop the CVAD from moving around. Dressings are changed when they become dirty or they start to fall off. Frequent dressing changes can cause damage to the surrounding skin, so patients may experience pain or skin damage when the dressing is removed. Changing the dressing frequently is also expensive. We wanted to see if there were any advantages or disadvantages to longer or shorter time intervals between CVAD dressing changes. Some hospitals or healthcare facilities recommend changing dressings every few days, while others keep dressings in place for longer. Review question   We reviewed the available evidence about the effect of different time intervals between dressing changes for CVADs and whether they had an effect on the risk of CRBSI and other complications. We found five studies that provided information for our review. Study characteristics   The five studies that were included in the review were published between 1995 and 2009 and involved a total of 2277 participants. Four countries were represented (two studies from France and one each from Italy, Sweden, and the Czech Republic). One study involved children and the remaining four trials included only adults. Four of the studies included cancer patients and one included patients in an intensive care unit. We classified the time intervals between dressing changes as short (2 ‐ 5 days) in the more frequently changed dressings group and long (5‐15 days) in the less frequently changed group. All studies used transparent dressings made of synthetic materials and two studies used gauze (a fabric dressing that does not stick to the skin) secured with tape when skin was damaged. CVAD dressings were monitored on a daily basis in all trials and participants were followed up at least until the CVAD was removed or until discharge. In one study, the manufacturer provided one of the products, but had no influence in the design or how the results were analysed and reported. Key results   The current evidence leaves us uncertain whether the frequency of dressing changes for CVADs influences risk of CRBSI or death. Of particular interest to patients are problems that may be associated with the dressing themselves, such as pain when they are removed and the skin damage that the dressing may cause. We found no clear evidence that pain, which was assessed daily, was affected by the frequency of dressing changes. Quality of evidence   The quality of the evidence was very low or low. We downgraded quality because of small and few studies, poor study designs and differences in results between the studies. Better designed studies are still needed to show whether longer interval or shorter intervals between dressing changes are more effective in preventing catheter related infections, mortality, skin damage, dressing removal pain, quality of life and cost. This plain language summary is up‐to‐date as of 10 June 2015.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Viral warts are a common skin condition, which can range in severity from a minor nuisance that resolve spontaneously to a troublesome, chronic condition. Many different topical treatments are available. Objectives To evaluate the efficacy of local treatments for cutaneous non‐genital warts in healthy, immunocompetent adults and children. Search methods We updated our searches of the following databases to May 2011: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in  The Cochrane Library , MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2010), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), and CINAHL (from 1981). We searched reference lists of articles and online trials registries for ongoing trials. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of topical treatments for cutaneous non‐genital warts. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected trials and extracted data; a third author resolved any disagreements. Main results We included 85 trials involving a total of 8815 randomised participants (26 new studies were included in this update). There was a wide range of different treatments and a variety of trial designs. Many of the studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in one or more areas of trial design. Trials of salicylic acid (SA) versus placebo showed that the former significantly increased the chance of clearance of warts at all sites (RR (risk ratio) 1.56, 95% CI (confidence interval) 1.20 to 2.03). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.43 to 5.01) and feet (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.55), suggested it might be more effective for hands than feet. A meta‐analysis of cryotherapy versus placebo for warts at all sites favoured neither intervention nor control (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.23). Subgroup analysis for different sites, hands (RR 2.63, 95% CI 0.43 to 15.94) and feet (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.26 to 3.07), again suggested better outcomes for hands than feet. One trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both placebo and SA, but only for hand warts. There was no significant difference in cure rates between cryotherapy at 2‐, 3‐, and 4‐weekly intervals. Aggressive cryotherapy appeared more effective than gentle cryotherapy (RR 1.90, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.15), but with increased adverse effects. Meta‐analysis did not demonstrate a significant difference in effectiveness between cryotherapy and SA at all sites (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.71) or in subgroup analyses for hands and feet. Two trials with 328 participants showed that SA and cryotherapy combined appeared more effective than SA alone (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.43). The benefit of intralesional bleomycin remains uncertain as the evidence was inconsistent. The most informative trial with 31 participants showed no significant difference in cure rate between bleomycin and saline injections (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.78). Dinitrochlorobenzene was more than twice as effective as placebo in 2 trials with 80 participants (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.38 to 3.26). Two trials of clear duct tape with 193 participants demonstrated no advantage over placebo (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.51 to 4.05). We could not combine data from trials of the following treatments: intralesional 5‐fluorouracil, topical zinc, silver nitrate (which demonstrated possible beneficial effects), topical 5‐fluorouracil, pulsed dye laser, photodynamic therapy, 80% phenol, 5% imiquimod cream, intralesional antigen, and topical alpha‐lactalbumin‐oleic acid (which showed no advantage over placebo). We did not identify any RCTs that evaluated surgery (curettage, excision), formaldehyde, podophyllotoxin, cantharidin, diphencyprone, or squaric acid dibutylester. Authors' conclusions Data from two new trials comparing SA and cryotherapy have allowed a better appraisal of their effectiveness. The evidence remains more consistent for SA, but only shows a modest therapeutic effect. Overall, trials comparing cryotherapy with placebo showed no significant difference in effectiveness, but the same was also true for trials comparing cryotherapy with SA. Only one trial showed cryotherapy to be better than both SA and placebo, and this was only for hand warts. Adverse effects, such as pain, blistering, and scarring, were not consistently reported but are probably more common with cryotherapy. None of the other reviewed treatments appeared safer or more effective than SA and cryotherapy. Two trials of clear duct tape demonstrated no advantage over placebo. Dinitrochlorobenzene (and possibly other similar contact sensitisers) may be useful for the treatment of refractory warts. Plain language summary Topical treatments for skin warts Viral warts are a common skin disease, most frequently affecting the hands and feet, caused by the human papilloma virus. While warts are not harmful and usually go away in time without any treatment, they can be unsightly and painful. Warts on the soles of the feet are also called 'plantar warts' or 'verrucas'. This review did not cover the treatment of genital warts, and it only considered the evidence provided by the results of randomised controlled trials. Salicylic acid (SA), a cheap and easily‐available solution painted on to warts, had a definite but modest beneficial effect compared to placebo. It is effective for warts at all sites and has few adverse effects, but it may take several weeks of daily use to work. Cryotherapy, usually using liquid nitrogen, is often used for the treatment of warts, but it is less convenient, more painful, and also more expensive. One study suggested that there is evidence that cryotherapy is better than SA for warts on the hands, but when we combined this study with our other results, we were unable to confirm this. We found that more aggressive cryotherapy appears to be more effective than gentle cryotherapy, but with an increased risk of adverse effects, such as pain, blistering, and scarring. We only looked at information from clinical trials of cryotherapy and not over‐the‐counter freezing treatments for warts, so we cannot say if these are as effective. During the production of the last version of this review, duct tape had gained favour as it is a safe and simple treatment that is easy to apply; however, the trial on which this was based was relatively small. In this updated review, we found two further trials of duct tape that suggested that this treatment is not as effective as first thought. Other treatments covered by this review include 5‐fluorouracil, dinitrochlorobenzene, intralesional bleomycin, intralesional interferon, photodynamic therapy, and intralesional antigen. None of these treatments are used commonly, even by skin specialists, and there is much less evidence for their effectiveness. The limited available evidence we do have suggests that some of these treatments may be effective and could therefore be used for warts that have not responded to simpler, safer treatments, such as salicylic acid or cryotherapy. Overall, providing a useful idea of 'what works' from such a wide range of studies was difficult as many studies were of poor quality.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background In epidemics of highly infectious diseases, such as Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) or SARS, healthcare workers (HCW) are at much greater risk of infection than the general population, due to their contact with patients' contaminated body fluids. Contact precautions by means of personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the risk. It is unclear which type of PPE protects best, what is the best way to remove PPE, and how to make sure HCWs use PPE as instructed. Objectives To evaluate which type or component of full‐body PPE and which method of donning or removing (doffing) PPE have the least risk of self‐contamination or infection for HCWs, and which training methods most increase compliance with PPE protocols. Search methods We searched MEDLINE (PubMed up to 8 January 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Trials (CENTRAL up to 20 January 2016), EMBASE (embase.com up to 8 January 2016), CINAHL (EBSCOhost up to 20 January 2016), and OSH‐Update up to 8 January 2016. We also screened reference lists of included trials and relevant reviews, and contacted NGOs and manufacturers of PPE. Selection criteria We included all eligible controlled studies that compared the effect of types or components of PPE in HCWs exposed to highly infectious diseases with serious consequences, such as EVD and SARS, on the risk of infection, contamination, or noncompliance with protocols. This included studies that simulated contamination with fluorescent markers or a non‐pathogenic virus. We also included studies that compared the effect of various ways of donning or removing PPE, and the effects of various types of training in PPE use on the same outcomes. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias in included trials. We intended to perform meta‐analyses but we did not find sufficiently similar studies to combine their results. Main results We included nine studies with 1200 participants evaluating ten interventions. Of these, eight trials simulated the exposure with a fluorescent marker or virus or bacteria containing fluids. Five studies evaluated different types of PPE against each other but two did not report sufficient data. Another two studies compared different types of donning and doffing and three studies evaluated the effect of different types of training. None of the included studies reported a standardised classification of the protective properties against viral penetration of the PPE, and only one reported the brand of PPE used. None of the studies were conducted with HCWs exposed to EVD but in one study participants were exposed to SARS. Different types of PPE versus each other In simulation studies, contamination rates varied from 25% to 100% of participants for all types of PPE. In one study, PPE made of more breathable material did not lead to a statistically significantly different number of spots with contamination but did have greater user satisfaction (Mean Difference (MD) ‐0.46 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) ‐0.84 to ‐0.08, range 1 to 5, very low quality evidence). In another study, gowns protected better than aprons. In yet another study, the use of a powered air‐purifying respirator protected better than a now outdated form of PPE. There were no studies on goggles versus face shields, on long‐ versus short‐sleeved gloves, or on the use of taping PPE parts together. Different methods of donning and doffing procedures versus each other Two cross‐over simulation studies (one RCT, one CCT) compared different methods for donning and doffing against each other. Double gloving led to less contamination compared to single gloving (Relative Risk (RR) 0.36; 95% CI 0.16 to 0.78, very low quality evidence) in one simulation study, but not to more noncompliance with guidance (RR 1.08; 95% CI 0.70 to 1.67, very low quality evidence). Following CDC recommendations for doffing led to less contamination in another study (very low quality evidence). There were no studies on the use of disinfectants while doffing. Different types of training versus each other In one study, the use of additional computer simulation led to less errors in doffing (MD ‐1.2, 95% CI ‐1.6 to ‐0.7) and in another study additional spoken instruction led to less errors (MD ‐0.9, 95% CI ‐1.4 to ‐0.4). One retrospective cohort study assessed the effect of active training ‐ defined as face‐to‐face instruction ‐ versus passive training ‐ defined as folders or videos ‐ on noncompliance with PPE use and on noncompliance with doffing guidance. Active training did not considerably reduce noncompliance in PPE use (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.63; 95% CI 0.31 to 1.30) but reduced noncompliance with doffing procedures (OR 0.45; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98, very low quality evidence). There were no studies on how to retain the results of training in the long term or on resource use. The quality of the evidence was very low for all comparisons because of high risk of bias in studies, indirectness of evidence, and small numbers of participants. This means that it is likely that the true effect can be substantially different from the one reported here. Authors' conclusions We found very low quality evidence that more breathable types of PPE may not lead to more contamination, but may have greater user satisfaction. We also found very low quality evidence that double gloving and CDC doffing guidance appear to decrease the risk of contamination and that more active training in PPE use may reduce PPE and doffing errors more than passive training. However, the data all come from single studies with high risk of bias and we are uncertain about the estimates of effects. We need simulation studies conducted with several dozens of participants, preferably using a non‐pathogenic virus, to find out which type and combination of PPE protects best, and what is the best way to remove PPE. We also need randomised controlled studies of the effects of one type of training versus another to find out which training works best in the long term. HCWs exposed to highly infectious diseases should have their use of PPE registered and should be prospectively followed for their risk of infection. Plain language summary Clothes and equipment for healthcare staff to prevent Ebola and other highly infective diseases Healthcare staff are at much greater risk of infections such as Ebola Virus Disease or SARS than people in general. One way of preventing infection is to use personal protective equipment, such as protective clothing, gloves, masks, and goggles to prevent contamination of the worker. It is unclear which type of equipment protects best and how it can best be removed after use. It is also unclear what is the best way to train workers to comply with guidance for this equipment. Studies found We found six studies with 295 participants in which workers' protective clothing was sprayed with a fluorescent marker or a harmless virus to simulate what happens in hospitals. Four of these compared different types of protective clothing. Two studies compared different ways of putting clothing on and taking it off. Three studies with 905 participants compared the effect of active training on the use of protective equipment to passive training. All studies had a high risk of bias. Various types of clothing compared In spite of protective clothing, the marker was found on the skin of 25% to 100% of workers. In one study, more breathable clothing did not lead to more contamination than non‐breathable clothing, but users were more satisfied. Gowns led to less contamination than aprons in another study. Two studies did not report enough data to enable conclusions. This evidence was of very low quality. Various types of removal of clothing compared In one study, two pairs of gloves led to less contamination than only one pair of gloves. The outer gloves were immediately removed after the task was finished. In another study, following CDC guidance for apron or gown removal led to less contamination. This evidence was also of very low quality. Active training Active training, including computer simulation and spoken instructions, led to less errors with guidance on which protection to use and how to remove it among healthcare staff compared to passive training. Quality of the evidence We judged the quality of the evidence to be very low because of limitations in the studies, indirectness and small numbers of participants. What do we still need to find out? There were no studies on the effects of goggles, face shields, long‐sleeved gloves or taping on the risk of contamination. We need simulation studies with several dozens of participants, preferably using exposure to a harmless virus, to find out which type and combination is most protective. The best way to remove protective clothing after use is also unclear. We need studies that use chance to assign workers to different types of training to find out which training works best. Healthcare staff exposed to highly infectious diseases should have their protective equipment registered and be followed for their risk of infection. We urge WHO and NGOs to organise more studies.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Treatment for lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) includes administering complementary oxygen. The effectiveness of oxygen therapy and of different delivery methods remains uncertain. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of oxygen therapy and oxygen delivery methods in the treatment of LRTIs and to define the indications for oxygen therapy in children with LRTIs. Search methods For this update, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS from March 2008 to October 2014. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non‐RCTs comparing oxygen versus no oxygen therapy or different methods of oxygen delivery in children with LRTI aged from three months to 15 years. To determine the indications for oxygen therapy, we included observational studies or diagnostic test accuracy studies. Data collection and analysis Three review authors independently scanned the search results to identify studies for inclusion. Two authors independently performed the methodological assessment and the third author resolved any disagreements. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and adverse events (AEs). We performed fixed‐effect meta‐analyses for the estimation of pooled effects whenever there was no heterogeneity between included RCTs. We summarised the results reported in the included observational studies for the clinical indicators of hypoxaemia. Main results In this review update, we included four studies (479 participants) assessing the efficacy of non‐invasive delivery methods for the treatment of LRTI in children and 14 observational studies assessing the clinical sign indicators of hypoxaemia in children with LRTIs. Three RCTs (399 participants) compared the effectiveness of nasal prongs or nasal cannula with nasopharyngeal catheter; one non‐RCT (80 participants) compared head box, face mask, nasopharyngeal catheter and nasal cannula. The nasopharyngeal catheter was the control group. Treatment failure was defined as number of children failing to achieve adequate arterial oxygen saturation. All included studies had a high risk of bias because of allocation methods and lack of blinded outcome assessment. For nasal prongs versus nasopharyngeal catheter, the pooled effect estimate for RCTs showed a worrying trend towards no difference between the groups (two RCTs; 239 participants; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.38). Similar results were shown in the one non‐RCT (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.27). The overall quality of this evidence is very low. Nasal obstruction due to severe mucus production was different between treatment groups (three RCTs, 338 participants; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.44; I 2  statistic = 0%). The quality of this evidence is low. The use of a face mask showed a statistically significant lower risk of failure to achieve arterial oxygen > 60 mmHg than the nasopharyngeal catheter (one non‐RCT; 80 participants; odds ratio (OR) 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.88). The use of a head box showed a non‐statistically significant trend towards a reduced risk of treatment failure compared to the nasopharyngeal catheter (one non‐RCT; OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.12). The quality of this evidence is very low. To determine the presence of hypoxaemia in children presenting with LRTI, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of nine clinical signs reported by the included observational studies and used this information to calculate likelihood ratios. The results showed that there is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies hypoxaemia. Authors' conclusions It appears that oxygen therapy given early in the course of pneumonia via nasal prongs at a flow rate of 1 to 2 L/min does not prevent children with severe pneumonia from developing hypoxaemia. However, the applicability of this evidence is limited as it comes from a small pilot trial. Nasal prongs and nasopharyngeal catheter are similar in effectiveness when used for children with LRTI. Nasal prongs are associated with fewer nasal obstruction problems. The use of a face mask and head box has been poorly studied and it is not superior to a nasopharyngeal catheter in terms of effectiveness or safety in children with LRTI. Studies assessing the effectiveness of oxygen therapy and oxygen delivery methods in children with different baseline risks are needed. There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies hypoxaemia in children with LRTI. The summary of results presented here can help clinicians to identify children with more severe conditions. This review is limited by the small number of trials assessing oxygen therapy and oxygen delivery methods as part of LRTI treatment. There is insufficient evidence to determine which non‐invasive delivery methods should be used in children with LRTI and low levels of oxygen in their blood. Plain language summary Oxygen therapy as part of the treatment for respiratory infections in children Review question   We reviewed the evidence about the beneficial effect of oxygen supplementation therapy as part of the treatment for children with acute lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). As oxygen may be administered using different delivery methods, we reviewed the most commonly used methods to deliver oxygen in children. As a secondary question, we reviewed the evidence regarding which signs or symptoms could indicate the need for oxygen therapy in children presenting with acute LRTI. Background   Acute LRTI is the most frequent cause for hospitalisation out of all respiratory infections and one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in children aged under five in low‐income countries. Oxygen therapy plays an important part in treating severe LRTIs but we need to determine its effectiveness at preventing children from developing more severe disease. Oxygen can be delivered by non‐invasive methods (nasal prongs, nasal cannula, nasopharyngeal catheter, face mask and head box) and we wanted to discover how effective these methods are as they have not been adequately evaluated. Studies characteristics   For our primary question we included experimental studies assessing the use of oxygen versus no oxygen and studies comparing oxygen delivery systems in children aged from one to five years with acute LRTI. We identified one pilot study (58 children) assessing oxygen therapy in children with pneumonia and four studies (479 participants) assessing the effectiveness of different non‐invasive oxygen delivery systems. For our secondary question, we included 14 observational studies conducted to determine the clinical indicators of hypoxaemia in children with acute LRTIs. Key results   It appears that oxygen therapy given early in the course of pneumonia via nasal prongs at a flow rate of 1 to 2 L/min does not prevent children with severe pneumonia from developing hypoxaemia. However, the applicability of this evidence is limited as it comes from a small pilot trial. Clinicians caring for children must make their decision to use supplemental oxygen on an individual basis. Nasal prongs and nasopharyngeal catheter are similar in effectiveness when used for children with acute LRTI. Nasal prongs are associated with less nasal obstruction. The use of a face mask and head box has been poorly studied and appears not to be superior to nasopharyngeal catheter in terms of effectiveness or safety when used in children with acute LRTI. There is no single clinical sign or symptom that accurately identifies hypoxaemia in children with acute LRTI. However, the summary of results presented here can help clinicians to identify children with more severe conditions. Studies assessing the effectiveness of oxygen therapy in children with different baseline risks are needed, as well as studies that aim to identify the most effective and safe oxygen delivery method. Our evidence is current to October 2014.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Intercostal catheters are commonly used for the drainage of intrathoracic collections in newborn infants, including pneumothorax and pleural effusions. Placement of an intercostal drain is a potential risk factor for nosocomial infection due to breach of the cutaneous barrier. Therefore, neonates who require intercostal drainage, especially those in high risk groups for nosocomial infection, may benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis. However, injudicious antibiotic use carries the risk of promoting the emergence of resistant strains of micro‐organisms or of altering the pattern of pathogens causing infection. Objectives To determine the effect of prophylactic antibiotics compared to selective use of antibiotics on mortality and morbidity (especially septicaemia) in neonates undergoing placement of an intercostal catheter. Search methods The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) ( The Cochrane Library  2011, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1948 to June 2011) and CINAHL (1982 to June 2011). Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials or some types of non‐randomised (that is, quasi‐randomised) controlled trials of adequate quality in which either individual newborn infants or clusters of infants were randomised to receive prophylactic antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment. Data collection and analysis We used the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Main results We did not find any randomised controlled trials that met the eligibility criteria. Authors' conclusions There are no data from randomised trials to either support or refute the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for intercostal catheter insertion in neonates. Any randomised controlled trials of antibiotic prophylaxis would need to account for the fact that neonates who require insertion of an intercostal catheter may already be receiving antibiotics for other indications. Plain language summary Prophylactic antibiotics to reduce morbidity and mortality in newborn infants with intercostal catheters There is no evidence to support or refute the use of preventive antibiotics in newborn babies with drainage tubes placed in the chest. Sick newborn babies occasionally need the insertion of a tube that is placed through the skin and into the lung space to drain air or fluid from around their lungs. Because this process involves breaching the skin barrier, there is a potential risk of infection. The group of babies most likely to need this procedure are also those that are most at risk of developing an infection during their stay in hospital. Preventive antibiotics are commonly used when there is a risk of infection, but they may have unwanted effects. The review authors found no evidence to support or refute the use of routine preventive antibiotics when intercostal catheters are inserted in newborn babies.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Meticillin‐resistant  Staphylococcus aureus  (MRSA; also known as met h icillin‐resistant  S aureus ) is a common hospital‐acquired pathogen that increases morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Its control continues to be an unresolved issue in many hospitals worldwide. The evidence base for the effects of the use of gloves, gowns or masks as control measures for MRSA is unclear. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of wearing gloves, a gown or a mask when contact is anticipated with a hospitalised patient colonised or infected with MRSA, or with the patient's immediate environment. Search methods We searched the Specialised Registers of three Cochrane Groups (Wounds Group on 5 June 2015; Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) Group on 9 July 2013; and Infectious Diseases Group on 5 January 2009); CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2015, Issue 6); DARE, HTA, NHS EED, and the Methodology Register ( The Cochrane Library  2015, Issue 6); MEDLINE and MEDLINE In‐Process & Other Non‐Indexed Citations (1946 to June week 1 2015); EMBASE (1974 to 4 June 2015); Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection (from inception to 7 June 2015); CINAHL (1982 to 5 June 2015); British Nursing Index (1985 to 6 July 2010); and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Database (1639 to 11 June 2015). We also searched three trials registers (on 6 June 2015), references list of articles, and conference proceedings. We finally contacted relevant individuals for additional studies. Selection criteria Studies assessing the effects on MRSA transmission of the use of gloves, gowns or masks by any person in the hospital setting when contact is anticipated with a hospitalised patient colonised or infected with MRSA, or with the patient's immediate environment. We did not assess adverse effects or economic issues associated with these interventions. We considered any comparator to be eligible. With regard to study design, only randomised controlled trials (clustered or not) and the following non‐randomised experimental studies were eligible: quasi‐randomised controlled trials (clustered or not), non‐randomised controlled trials (clustered or not), controlled before‐and‐after studies, controlled cohort before‐after studies, interrupted time series studies (controlled or not), and repeated measures studies. We did not exclude any study on the basis of language or date of publication. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently decided on eligibility of the studies. Had any study having been included, two review authors would have extracted data (at least for outcome data) and assessed the risk of bias independently. We would have followed the standard methodological procedures suggested by Cochrane and the Cochrane EPOC Group for assessing risk of bias and analysing the data. Main results We identified no eligible studies for this review, either completed or ongoing. Authors' conclusions We found no studies assessing the effects of wearing gloves, gowns or masks for contact with MRSA hospitalised patients, or with their immediate environment, on the transmission of MRSA to patients, hospital staff, patients' caregivers or visitors. This absence of evidence should not be interpreted as evidence of no effect for these interventions. The effects of gloves, gowns and masks in these circumstances have yet to be determined by rigorous experimental studies, such as cluster‐randomised trials involving multiple wards or hospitals, or interrupted time series studies. Plain language summary Use of gloves, a gown or a mask for contact with hospitalised patients with  Staphylococcus aureus  resistant to a common antibiotic (MRSA) What is MRSA, and why is it a problem in hospitals? MRSA stands for 'meticillin‐ (or methicillin‐) resistant  Staphylococcus aureus'.  This is a common type of bacterium ( Staphylococcus aureus ) that is no longer killed by meticillin (also known as 'methicillin', an antibiotic) or other antibiotics that are frequently used to treat infections. MRSA can live on people without making them ill, and without them showing any symptoms, but is dangerous when it infects people who are unwell. MRSA is easily transferred from one patient to another in hospitals, where it causes severe infections and can cause death. This transmission occurs mainly through healthcare workers when their hands, clothes, or equipment become contaminated with MRSA during routine care of patients who have MRSA. Later contact of the contaminated hands, clothes or equipment with other patients allows MRSA to spread within the hospital. Why might use of gloves, gowns or masks help prevent transmission of MRSA between patients in hospitals? It is possible that the use of disposable gloves with or without the use of disposable or washable gowns could prevent transmission of MRSA, as they would protect the healthcare workers' hands and clothes from becoming contaminated with MRSA. The gloves and gowns would be discarded after one patient had been cared for, and clean ones used to visit the next patient. The use of masks might also prevent spread of MRSA through the air. It is not known whether use of gloves, gowns or masks reduces the spread of MRSA when they are used individually, or whether combining two of the three, or all three, produces better results. The aim of this research and what the researchers found The researchers aimed to find out whether the use of gloves, a gown or a mask by any person in the hospital (for example, a doctor) getting close to a patient found to have MRSA prevents the transmission of MRSA from this patient to other people in the hospital. The researchers made a wide search of the medical literature, up to June 2015, but did not find any rigorous studies that addressed this topic. At present there is no scientific evidence that the wearing of gloves, a gown, or a mask by people getting close to patients with MRSA reduces the transmission of MRSA to other people in the hospital. However, this should not be interpreted as demonstrating that gloves, gowns or masks are not effective; it means that the research that would be required to measure an effect ‐ if there is one ‐ has not been done yet.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Artificial and bioartificial liver support systems may 'bridge' patients with acute or acute‐on‐chronic liver failure to liver transplantation or recovery. Objectives To evaluate beneficial and harmful effects of artificial and bioartificial support systems for acute and acute‐on‐chronic liver failure. Search methods Trials were identified through the  Cochrane Hepato‐Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register  (September 2002),  The Cochrane Library  (Issue 3, 2002),  MEDLINE  (1966 to September 2002),  EMBASE  (1985 to September 2002), and  The Chinese Biomedical Database  (September 2002), manual searches of bibliographies and journals, authors of trials, and pharmaceutical companies. Selection criteria Randomised clinical trials on artificial or bioartificial support systems for acute or acute on‐chronic liver failure were included irrespective of blinding, publication status, or language. Non‐randomised studies were included in explorative analyses. Data collection and analysis Data were extracted independently by three authors. Results were presented as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Sources of heterogeneity were explored through sensitivity analyses and meta‐regression. The primary outcome was mortality. Main results Twelve trials on artificial or bioartificial support systems versus standard medical therapy (483 patients) and two trials comparing different artificial support systems (105 patients) were included. Most trials had unclear methodological quality. Compared to standard medical therapy, support systems had no significant effect on mortality (RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.12) or bridging to liver transplantation (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.05), but a significant beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.52 to 0.86). Meta‐regression indicated that the effect of support systems depended on the type of liver failure (P = 0.03). In subgroup analyses, artificial support systems appeared to reduce mortality by 33% in acute‐on‐chronic liver failure (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.90), but not in acute liver failure (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.29). Two trials comparing artificial support systems showed significant mortality reductions with intermittent versus continuous haemofiltration (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.36 to 0.94) and no significant difference between five versus ten hours of charcoal haemoperfusion (RR 1.03; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.62). The incidence of adverse events was inconsistently reported. Authors' conclusions This Review indicates that artificial support systems may reduce mortality in acute‐on‐chronic liver failure. Artificial and bioartificial support systems did not appear to affect mortality in acute liver failure. However, considering the strength of the evidence additional randomised clinical trials are needed before any support system can be recommended for routine use. Plain language summary The benefit of artificial and bioartificial liver support systems looks promising Liver failure may develop without pre‐existing liver disease (acute liver failure) or with pre‐existing liver disease (acute‐on‐chronic liver failure). Both disorders are serious and may lead to death. Artificial and bioartificial support systems may 'bridge' patients to liver transplantation or spontaneous recovery. Evidence from twelve small randomised trials were combined. Most trials had unclear methodologic quality. Overall, support systems did not appear to affect mortality or bridging to transplantation, but had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy. The risk of adverse events could not be established. Further evidence is needed before support systems can be recommended for routine use.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Systemic antibiotics and antibiotic‐impregnated shunt systems are often used to prevent shunt infection. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of either prophylactic systemic antibiotics or antibiotic‐impregnated shunt systems for preventing infection in patients who underwent surgical introduction of intracranial ventricular shunts. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS and the meeting proceedings from the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and from the European Association of Neurosurgical Societies, until June 2005. Selection criteria We included randomized or quasi‐randomized controlled trials comparing the use of prophylactic antibiotics (either systemic or antibiotic‐impregnated shunt systems) in intracranial ventricular shunt procedures with placebo or no antibiotics. Data collection and analysis Two authors appraised quality and extracted data independently. Main results We included seventeen trials with overall 2134 participants. We performed two separate meta‐analyses: one that evaluated the use of systemic prophylactic antibiotics and another that evaluated the use of antibiotic‐impregnated systems. All studies included shunt infection in their primary outcome. We could not analyse all‐cause mortality regarding systemic antibiotics due to lack of data. No significant differences were found (odds ratio (OR): 1.47, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.83 to 2.62) for this outcome regarding the use of antibiotic‐impregnated catheters compared with standard ones. The use of systemic antibiotic prophylaxis and the use of antibiotic‐impregnated catheters were associated with a decrease in shunt infection (OR: 0.52, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.74 and OR: 0.21, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.55 respectively). We found no significant benefit for shunt revision in both meta‐analyses that evaluated systemic antibiotics and impregnated‐shunt systems. We found no significant differences between the subgroups evaluated: type of shunt (internal/external, ventriculoperitoneal/ventriculoatrial), age and duration of the administration of antibiotics. Authors' conclusions We could demonstrate a benefit of systemic prophylactic antibiotics for the first 24 hours postoperatively to prevent shunt infection, regardless of the patient's age and the type of internal shunt used. The benefit of its use after this period remains uncertain. However this data derives from the rate of shunt infection, which is an intermediary outcome. Future trials should evaluate the effectiveness of different regimens of systemic antibiotics rather than placebo, and should include all‐cause mortality, shunt revision and adverse events as additional outcomes. Evidence suggests that antibiotic‐impregnated catheters reduce the incidence of shunt infection although more well‐designed clinical trials testing the effect of antibiotic‐impregnated shunts are required to confirm their net benefit. Plain language summary A review of the medical literature for evidence of whether the use of intravenous antibiotics, or devices impregnated with antibiotics, reduce the risks of infection during the surgical placement of catheters for the drainage of excess fluid from the brain An intracranial ventricular shunt is a device (catheter/tube) used to drain an excess of cerebrospinal fluid from the brain. (Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear body fluid released into the subarachnoid space; the subarachnoid space surrounds the brain and the spinal cord.) Patients with intracranial ventricular shunts are prone to infection. Some doctors give either antibiotic drugs or use antibiotic‐impregnated devices to reduce the risk of infection. Our review included randomized controlled trials that compared the incidence of shunt infection in patients who were given preventive antibiotic therapy with those who did not receive these drugs. We also included trials comparing antibiotic‐impregnated shunt systems with those who received non‐antibiotic impregnated shunts. We included seventeen trials in our review. Although the available data does not provide much detail on mortality or the adverse events caused by antibiotics (an adverse event is an incident in which harm resulted to a person receiving the health care) it does support the use of preventative systemic prophylactic antibiotics for the first 24 hours postoperatively following an intracranial ventricular shunt operation or the use of antibiotic‐impregnated catheters. However this data was obtained from an intermediary outcome which is the rate of shunt infections. Therefore although the evidence suggests that the use of antibiotics is beneficial in reducing the incidence of shunt infection more research is needed to confirm their benefit.},

abstract = {Abstract - Background Tuberculosis is generally curable with chemotherapy, but there is controversy in the literature about the need for surgical intervention in the one to two per cent of people with tuberculosis of the spine. Objectives To compare chemotherapy plus surgery with chemotherapy alone for treating people diagnosed with active tuberculosis of the spine. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (February 2010), CENTRAL ( The Cochrane Library  2010, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to February 2010), EMBASE (1974 to February 2010), LILACS (1982 to February 2010), conference proceedings, and reference lists. A search update in November 2012 revealed no new studies. Selection criteria Randomized controlled trials with at least one year follow up that compared chemotherapy plus surgery with chemotherapy alone for treating active tuberculosis of the thoracic and/or lumbar spine. Data collection and analysis Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, methodological quality, and extracted data. We analysed data using odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals. Main results Two randomized controlled trials (331 participants) met the inclusion criteria. They were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s with follow‐up reports available after 18 months, three years, and five years; one trial also reported 10 years follow up. Completeness of follow up varied at the different time points, with less than 80% of participants available for analysis at several time points. There was no statistically significant difference for any of the outcome measures: kyphosis angle, neurological deficit (none went on to develop this), bony fusion, absence of spinal tuberculosis, death from any cause, activity level regained, change of allocated treatment, or bone loss. Neither trial reported on pain. Of the 130 participants allocated to chemotherapy only, 12 had a neurological deficit and five needed a decompression operation. One trial suggested that an initial kyphosis angle greater than 30° is likely to deteriorate, especially in children. Authors' conclusions The two included trials had too few participants to be able to say whether routine surgery might help. Although current medication and operative techniques are now far more advanced, these results indicate that routine surgery cannot be recommended unless within the context of a large, well‐conducted randomized controlled trial. Clinicians may judge that surgery may be clinically indicated in some groups of patients. Future studies need to address these topics as well as the patient's view of their disease and treatment. Plain language summary Not enough evidence on the routine use of surgery in addition to drug treatment for people with tuberculosis of the spine Spinal tuberculosis (spinal TB) occurs in about 1% to 2% of people with TB (the most common infectious disease in the world). The disease can have a major impact on people's lives. Nerves can be squeezed causing pain, loss of feeling, and breathing problems. It can cause bone loss and curvature of the spine, which can lead to loss of nerve function and paralysis after some years, even if the TB has been cured. Correcting with surgery at this point can be difficult because of the complexity of the surgery required. It has been suggested that surgery might be undertaken at the time the TB of the spine is diagnosed and drug treatment (chemotherapy) is being used. However, all surgery has potential adverse effects. This review of trials found there were insufficient numbers of participants in the two trials located (331 participants) to be able to say if routine surgery early on was of overall benefit. Further trials are needed and such trials should assess the pain that people suffer and their views of the disease and treatment.},
