  abstract = {Purpose: 
To compare complications of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) for the treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs).
Background: 
PVP and BKP are two minimally invasive procedures for treating OVCFs, while few studies emphases attention to intra- and post-operative complications about the two procedures.
Methods: 
Online databases were searched for studies comparing complications of PVP and BKP for OVCFs, the randomized controlled trials, clinical controlled trials and cohort studies that provided related data were identified. Demographic characteristics and complications related to procedures were extracted and analysed from all of the included studies.
Results: 
Nineteen studies encompassing 1,787 patients in total, of whom 887 received PVP and 900 received BKP, met the inclusion criteria. For subsequent fractures, our meta-analysis detected no significant difference between the two procedures, both for adjacent fractures (p = 0.29) and non-adjacent fractures (p = 0.37). For cement extravasations, there was no significant difference between the two interventions if considering disc spaces extravasations only (p = 0.24), while considering total extravasations and paravertebral extravasations, the cement leakage rate in the PVP group was significantly higher than the BKP group (total: p < 0.01; paravertebral: p < 0.01).
Conclusions: 
The two procedures suffer from equal risk of subsequent spinal fractures; PVP has a significant higher cement leakage rate compared to BKP, mainly caused by a higher paravertebral leakage, patients with extremely poor pulmonary function or unstable haemodynamic are better candidates for BKP.},

Prospective study.
Objective: 
The aim of this study was to demonstrate the safe range of cement volume during percutaneous vertebroplasty.
Summary of background data: 
A few clinical reports have addressed the relationship between cement volume and clinical outcome. However, the weakness of these studies was that subjects included were not homogeneous. No study in the clinical setting has confirmed results from biomechanical and computational studies.
Methods: 
We examined 96 patients with single compression fractures who underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty and postoperative three-dimensional CT scan within a week between June 2006 and April 2009. The volume and fraction were measured by a CT volumetry program. Relationships between predictors and volumetric data, outcome, leakage, intraverterbal vacuum cleft (IVVC), and subsequent fracture were examined. Relationships between volumetric data and outcome, leakage, IVVC, and subsequent fracture were analyzed with stratification by the treated level. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to acquire cut-off values of volumetric data.
Results: 
Seventy-three patients (76%) were female, and the mean age was 76.3 ± 8.4 years (range 53-97). The mean duration of follow-up was 11 months (range 6-21). Locations were as follows: T4-T10 9, T11-L1-L57, and L2-L4 30. Seventy-eight patients (81%) reported a favorable outcome. Fractured body volume (FBV) and the level treated were associated with fraction, which had an influence on outcome. The fraction of the favorable group was significantly higher. Cut-off values to acquire a favorable outcome were 11.64% (P = 0.026) on the T4-L4 level and 3.35 cm (P = 0.059), 11.65% (P = 0.059) on the T11-L1 level. Group with intradiscal leakage had a smaller volume than nonleakage group on the L2-L4 level (3.86 cm vs. 5.65 cm, P = 0.002). There were no relationships of volumetric data with epidural leakage and pulmonary embolism. The presence of IVVC increased volume on the T4-L4 and L2-L4 level (P < 0.03). Larger volume increased significantly the incidence of adjacent fracture on the L2-L4 level. The significant cut-off volume to avoid adjacent fracture was 4.90 cm on the ROC curve.
Conclusion: 
It is suggested that fraction is superior to volume for predicting outcome on the T11-L1 level and an amount of cement should be determined in terms of FBV and fraction according to the treated level. A lower fraction than required for the restoration of mechanical property was enough to obtain pain relief. Intradiscal leakage on the L2-L4 level may be inevitable to obtain appropriate mechanical properties in the case of severe endplate breakdown connected with the disc space. Smaller volume is needed to avoid an adjacent fracture on the L2-L4 level. Although we did not know the reason why there was a difference among the treated level groups, one thing that is certain is the fact that level-specific approaches may be necessary for good outcome in terms of volume, fraction and FBV.},

  abstract = {Introduction: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) was introduced in 1984 and has proved to be valuable in the treatment of painful vertebral lesions such as haemangiomas, metastasis, and osteoporotic fractures. According to the literature, the operation provides pain relief with only few and harmless complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate our perioperative experiences with special reference to the safety of the procedure.
Material and methods: 
A total of 156 procedures were performed in 148 patients with osteoporotic fractures. Both acute and chronic fractures were treated. All patients had plain radiographs of the spine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or bone scans were performed in case of old fractures or more than one fracture in patients with acute back-pain. At follow-up after three and 12 months, plain radiographs were performed in conjunction with physical examinations and interviews. Data were collected retrospectively.
Results: 
We identified 40.4% cemental leaks (confidence interval (CI) 32.6; 48.5). None of these resulted in neurological symptoms. One patient experienced shortness of breath after the procedure, one had atrial fibrillation, and one patient had an iatrogenic pneumothorax. In all, the frequency of symptomatic complications was 1.9% (CI -0.4; 5.5).
Conclusion: 
We believe that PVP is a safe procedure with only few symptomatic complications when performed under local anaesthesia and by a specialist in transpedicular approach.},

Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) has recently become a very common procedure for vertebral compression fractures. Extravasation of cement, a common event associated with vertebroplasty, may lead to cement emboli in the lungs.
Purpose: 
To determine the frequency of pulmonary cement embolism after percutaneous vertebroplasty.
Material and methods: 
Between 2002 and 2006, 128 percutaneous vertebroplasties were performed in 73 patients (56 women and 17 men) in our institution. Postprocedural chest radiographs were obtained for all patients and assessed for the presence of pulmonary cement emboli.
Results: 
Pulmonary cement embolism was detected on chest radiographs and confirmed with chest computed tomography (CT) in four patients treated with percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic collapse and one patient treated for multiple myeloma. The imaging finding of pulmonary cement embolism was solitary or multiple fine radiodense lines with occasional branching patterns. The frequency of pulmonary cement embolism was 6.8%.
Conclusion: 
An incidence of pulmonary cement embolism of 6.8% during PV was found. Close clinical follow-up, postprocedural chest radiographs, and chest CT scans, if necessary, are important for the detection of pulmonary cement embolism at an early stage.},

  abstract = {Background: 
Vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive procedure commonly performed for vertebral compression fractures secondary to osteoporosis or malignancy. Leakage of bone cement into the paravertebral venous system and cement pulmonary embolism (cPE) are well described, mostly in patients with osteoporosis. Little is known about the clinical sequelae and outcomes in cancer patients. In this study, we report our experience with cPE following vertebroplasty performed in cancer patients.
Methods: 
Records of all consecutive cancer patients who underwent vertebroplasty at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. The procedure was performed via percutaneous injection of barium-opacified polymethyl-methacrylate cement.
Results: 
A total of 102 cancer patients with a median age of 53 (19-83) years were included. Seventy-eight (76.5%) patients had malignant vertebral fractures, and 24 (23.5%) patients had osteoporotic fractures. Cement PE was detected in 13 (12.7%) patients; 10 (76.9%) patients had malignant fractures, and the remaining three had osteoporotic fractures. Cement PE was mostly asymptomatic; however, 5 (38.5%) patients had respiratory symptoms that led to the diagnosis. Only the five symptomatic patients were anticoagulated. Cement PE was more common with multiple myeloma (MM); it occurred in 7 (18.9%) of the 37 patients with MM compared with only three (7.3%) of the 41 patients with other malignancies. No difference in incidence was observed between patients with osteoporotic or malignant vertebral fractures.
Conclusions: 
Cement PE is a relatively common complication following vertebroplasty and is mostly asymptomatic. Multiple myeloma is associated with the highest risk. Large-scale prospective studies can help identify risk factors and clinical outcomes and could lead to better prevention and therapeutic strategies.},

  abstract = {Background and context: 
Minimally invasive percutaneous vertebral augmentation techniques; vertebroplasty, and kyphoplasty have been treatment choices for vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of the patients who underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty regarding complications, correction of vertebral body height, kyphosis angle and pain relief assessment using visual analog score (VAS) for pain.
Materials and methods: 
A retrospective review of the hospital records for 100 consecutive patients treated with kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty in our department database. Patients with osteoporotic compression fractures, traumatic compressions, and osteolytic vertebral lesions, including metastases, hemangiomas, and multiple myeloma, were included in the study. Preoperative and postoperative VAS pain scores, percentages of vertebral compression and kyphotic angles were measured and compared as well as demographic characteristics and postoperative complications. Mobilization and length of stay (LOS) were recorded.
Results: 
One hundred patients were treated by 110 procedures. 64 patients were operated on due to osteoporosis (72 procedures). Twelve patients were operated on because of metastasis (13 procedures), 8 patients were operated on because of multiple myeloma (9 procedures). Five patients had two surgeries, 1 patient had 3 surgeries, and 1 patient had 5 surgeries. The mean preoperative VAS was 74.05 ± 9.8. In total, 175 levels were treated, 46 levels by kyphoplasty and 129 by vertebroplasty. The mean postoperative VAS was 20.94 ± 11.8. Most of the patients were mobilized in the same day they of surgery. Mean LOS was 1.83 days. Six patients had nonsymptomatic leakage of polymethlymethacrylate, and patient had epidural hematoma, which was operated on performing hemi-laminectomy.
Conclusions: 
Percutaneous vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty are both effective and safe minimally invasive procedures for the stabilization of VCFs. However, complications should be kept in mind during decision making.},

  abstract = {Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) is a minimally invasive procedure widely used for the treatment of pain due to vertebral fractures of different origins-osteoporotic, traumatic, or neoplastic. PVP is minimally invasive, but the complications are not rare; however, they are in most cases not significant clinically. The most frequent is cement leakage, which can occur onto veins, paravertebral soft tissue, into the intervertebral disk, or to the spinal canal, affecting foraminal area or epidural space. We analyzed results of treatment and complications of vertebroplasty performed with the use of polimethylomethylacrylate cement (PMMA) on 1100 vertebrae, with a special regard to the severity of complication and eventual clinical manifestation. One thousand one hundred PVP were analyzed, performed in 616 patients. There were 468 (76%) women and 148 men (24%), 24 to 94-year old, mean age 68 years. From 1100 procedures, 794 treated osteporotic and 137 fractures due to malignant disease, 69 PVP were made in traumatic fractures. One hundred patients had painful vertebral hemangiomas. Seven hundred twenty-six (66%) lesions were in thoracic, and 374 (34%) in lumbar area. Results of treatment were assessed using 10 cm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 12 hours after surgery, 7 days, 30 days, and then each 6 months, up to 3 years. Before surgery all patients had significant pain 7 to 10 in VAS scale, mean 8.9 cm. Twelve  hours after surgery 602 (97.7%) reported significant relief of pain, with mean VAS of 2,3 cm. Local complications occurred in 50% of osteoporotic, 34% of neoplastic, 16% of traumatic fractures, and 2% of vertebral hemangiomas. The most common was PMMA leakage into surrounding tissues-20%; paravertebral vein embolism-13%; intradiscal leakage-8%; and PMMA leakage into the spinal canal-0.8%. Results of treatment did not differ between patients with and without any complications. From 104 patients who had chest X-ray or CT study performed after surgery, pulmonary embolism was noted in 2 patients, but without any clinical symptoms. Only 1 patient-with PMMA leakage into the spinal canal required surgical decompression In conclusion, PVP is effective in decreasing the level of pain in compression vertebral fractures. Complications occur in almost half of the patients but in more than 95% of them do not produce any clinical symptoms.},

Vertebroplasty is one of the minimally invasive surgery that benefit in pain relief from the osteoporotic or malignancy related vertebral compression fractures. However, many literatures reported both asymptomatic and serious complications. The aim of the present study was to summarize, collect data and report the complication ofvertebroplastyfrom our experience at a single institute.
Material and method: 
Three hundred and twenty five vertebroplasty procedures from 236 patients performed in our institute were retrospectively reviewed. Data of diagnosis, age at the time of procedure were collected. All complications found were reviewed in detail.
Results: 
Commonly performed procedures were at thoracolumbar junction (51.4%). Osteoporosis was the most common cause of fracture. The present study found 88 (27%) complications with 26 (8%) symptomatic patients. Most common complication was cement leakage, which intervertebral disc was the most common site (42.9). Spinal canal leakage was found in 14 cases (20%). Four out of 14 cases had neurological complications and need further managements. Two cases had neurologic complications from needle injury.Adjacent level collapse found in 13 patients (4%) and remote segment collapse occurred in 5 patients (1.5%). Three had progressive kyphosis required later surgical treatment. One asymptomatic cement pulmonary embolism was found in the present study.
Conclusion: 
The complications of vertebroplasty were mostly asymptomatic, but serious complication such as neurologic injury could occur. Vertebroplasty could be considered a quite safe treatment for osteoporotic vertebral fracture. Meticulous technique should be executed during the procedure to avoid the leakage complication.},

To retrospectively evaluate the incidence and clinical impact of local polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) leaks and pulmonary cement embolisms occurring under CT fluoroscopy-guided vertebroplasty of symptomatic malignant vertebral osteolyses.
Materials and methods: 
From December 2001 to June 2009, 202 cancer patients (116 women, 86 men; age 63.2±8.6 years) with painful malignant vertebral osteolyses underwent vertebroplasty, with or without vertebral compression fracture. A total of 331 vertebrae were treated in 231 sessions under CT fluoroscopy guidance (120 kV; 10–25 mA; single slice, 4-, 16-, and 128-row CT). In the pre-vertebroplasty CT, the following items were assessed: osteolytic destruction (0, ≤25, ≤50, ≤75, or ≤100%) of vertebral cross-sectional area, posterior wall, and circumference; presence of perivertebral and degree of epidural (no, mild, moderate) soft tissue involvement. Local PMMA leaks were analyzed using the post-vertebroplasty CT. Pulmonary cement embolisms were evaluated in all patients having undergone radiography (CR; n053) or CT (n088) of the chest after vertebroplasty due to their underlying disease. Patient charts were reviewed regarding adverse events.
Results: 
Of 331 treated vertebrae, 32, 20.2, and 15.7% showed more than 50% osteolytic involvement of the vertebral cross-sectional area, posterior wall, and circumference, respectively. Mild or moderate epidural involvement was seen in 13.0 and 8.4%. Local PMMA leakage rate was 58.6% (194 of 331 vertebrae). Pulmonary cement embolisms (segmental, n010; central, n01) were seen after 7.8% of the procedures with follow-up imaging of the chest. No major complications occurred within a 30-day period after vertebroplasty.
Conclusion: 
Vertebroplasty of spinal malignancy can be safely performed under CT fluoroscopy guidance even in patients with substantial osteolytic involvement. In our patient collective, PMMA leaks and pulmonary cement embolisms visualized in post-procedural radiography and CT images had no clinical impact.},

Vertebroplasty is a well-known technique used to treat pain associated with vertebral compression fractures. Despite a success rate of up to 90% in different series, the procedure is often associated with major complications such as cord and root compression, epidural and subdural hematomas (SDHs), and pulmonary emboli, as well as other minor complications. In this study, the authors discuss the major complications of transpedicular vertebroplasty and their clinical implications during the postoperative course.
Methods: 
Vertebroplasty was performed in 12 vertebrae of 7 patients. Five patients had osteoporotic compression fractures, 1 had tumoral compression fractures, and 1 had a traumatic fracture. Two patients had foraminal leakage, 1 had epidural leakage, 1 had subdural cement leakage, 2 had a spinal SDH, and the last had a split fracture after the procedure.
Results: 
Three patients had paraparesis (2 had SDHs and 1 had epidural cement leakage), 3 had root symptoms, and 1 had lower back pain. Two of the 3 patients with paraparesis recovered after evacuation of the SDH and subdural cement; however, 1 patient with paraparesis did not recover after epidural cement leakage, despite cement evacuation. Two patients with foraminal leakage and 1 with subdural cement leakage had root symptoms and recovered after evacuation and conservative treatment. The patient with the split fracture had no neurological symptoms and recovered with conservative treatment.
Conclusions: 
Transpedicular vertebroplasty may have major complications, such as a spinal SDH and/or cement leakage into the epidural and subdural spaces, even when performed by experienced spinal surgeons. Early diagnosis with CT and intervention may prevent worsening of these complications.},

  abstract = {Objective: 
To analyze the reasons of the complications,and the measures taken for the prevention and treatment by percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for osteoporotic thoracolumbars vertebral compressive fractures.
Methods: 
From May 2004 to June 2008, 204 patients with 286 diseased vertebrae underwent PVP under the guidance of C-arm fluoroscopy, and 56 patients with complications included 18 males, 38 females, ranging in age from 58 to 93 years, with an average of 72 years. The condition of leakage of bone cement and complications was observed.
Results: 
The complications related to the leakage of PMMA found in 60 vertebrae in 49 cases: vertebral canal in 5 cases, intervertebral foramina in 3 cases, soft tissue besides vertebrae in 20 cases,intervertebral discs in 15 cases, venous plexus besides vertebrae in 6 cases. The complications no related to the leakage of PMMA found in 7 cases: the nerve roots injuried in 3 cases; the pain of the patient worsened temporarily in 2 cases; the blood pressure of the patient descent temporarily in 2 cases.
Conclusion: 
The main reasons of complications are no-integrated of the compressived vertebrae,unstandard skills of injecting,unsuitable opportunity and quantity of injecting PMMA, unsufficient monitoring of C-arm fluoroscopy, the toxicity of PMMA. The measures of prevention and treatment is strict indication, standard skills of injecting, sufficient monitoring of C-arm fluoroscopy, suitable opportunity and quantity of injecting PMMA, electrocardio-monitoring in operation.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to analyze the technical results, the extraosseous cement leakages, and the complications in our first 500 vertebroplasty procedures. Patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures or osteolytic lesions caused by malignant tumors were treated with CT-guided vertebroplasty. The technical results were documented with CT, and the extraosseous cement leakages and periinterventional clinical complications were analyzed as well as secondary fractures during follow-up. Since 2002, 500 vertebroplasty procedures have been performed on 251 patients (82 male, 169 female, age 71.5 +/- 9.8 years) suffering from osteoporotic compression fractures (n = 217) and/or malignant tumour infiltration (n = 34). The number of vertebrae treated per patient was 1.96 +/- 1.29 (range 1-10); the numbers of interventions per patient and interventions per vertebra were 1.33 +/- 0.75 (range 1-6) and 1.01 +/- 0.10, respectively. The amount of PMMA cement was 4.5 +/- 1.9 ml and decreased during the 5-year period of investigation. The procedure-related 30-day mortality was 0.4% (1 of 251 patients) due to pulmonary embolism in this case. The procedure-related morbidity was 2.8% (7/251), including one acute coronary syndrome beginning 12 h after the procedure and one missing patellar reflex in a patients with a cement leak near the neuroformen because of osteolytic destruction of the respective pedicle. Additionally, one patient developed a medullary conus syndrome after a fall during the night after vertebroplasty, two patients reached an inadequate depth of conscious sedation, and two cases had additional fractures (one pedicle fracture, one rib fracture). The overall CT-based cement leak rate was 55.4% and included leakages predominantly into intervertebral disc spaces (25.2%), epidural vein plexus (16.0%), through the posterior wall (2.6%), into the neuroforamen (1.6%), into paravertebral vessels (7.2%), and combinations of these and others. During follow-up (15.2 +/- 13.4 months) the secondary fracture rate was 17.1%, including comparable numbers for vertebrae at adjacent and distant levels. The presence of intradiscal cement leaks was not associated with increased adjacent fracture rates. CT-guided vertebroplasty is safe and effective for treatment of vertebral compression fractures. CT-fluoroscopy provides an excellent control of the posterior vertebral wall. The number of cement leakages alone is not directly associated with clinical complications. However, even small volumes of pulmonary PMMA embolism might be responsible for the fatal outcome in cases with underlying cardiopulmonary insufficiency.},

  abstract = {Background and purpose: 
Percutaneous polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) vertebroplasty has become a common procedure for treatment of pain and disability associated with vertebral compression fractures. We reviewed the experience with our first 1000 consecutively treated vertebral compression fractures in an attempt to demonstrate both the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of percutaneous vertebroplasty.
Materials and methods: 
The first 1000 compression fractures treated by vertebroplasty at our institution were identified from a comprehensive prospectively acquired vertebroplasty data base. All patients treated with vertebroplasty were included, regardless of the underlying pathologic cause. Chart reviews of the procedure notes, imaging studies, clinical visits, and follow-up telephone interviews were performed for each patient. Evaluation at each follow-up time point included pain response (subjective and visual analog pain score), change in mobility, change in pain medication usage, and modified Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed on the pain response and change in the Roland-Morris score at each follow-up time point. Significant procedure-related complications that occurred from the time of the procedure were also specifically extracted from the patients' charts.
Results: 
There was a dramatic improvement in all the evaluated parameters following percutaneous vertebroplasty. The improvement in pain, mobility, medication usage, and Roland-Morris score was noticed immediately after the procedure and persisted through the 2-year follow-up. There was a low rate of complications from the procedure, the most common being rib fractures.
Conclusion: 
According to our results, practitioners can quote a high success rate and low complication rate for vertebroplasty when making treatment recommendations for painful spinal compression fractures.},

  abstract = {Purpose: 
To compare the technical success and complication rates in CT-guided vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty.
Materials and methods: 
From 2002 - 2005 69 patients (101 vertebrae) were treated with vertebroplasty (n = 82) or kyphoplasty (n = 19) using 4-slice MSCT with CT fluoroscopy as the sole guidance for the procedure. The underlying lesions were osteoporotic fractures in 78 vertebral bodies and 23 vertebral metastases.
Results: 
Technical success was achieved in all 101 procedures. Post-interventional CT demonstrated asymptomatic cement leakage in 51/101 vertebrae. Kyphoplasty resulted in leakage in 11/19 (57.9 %) and vertebroplasty in 40/82 (48.8 %) procedures. With p = 0.48 (Mann-Whitney Test) there was no significant difference between kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty with respect to the number of cement leakage occurrences. There was one minor complication of an L5 root irritation following radiofrequency ablation and vertebroplasty of a sarcoma metastasis which subsided without treatment after 8 weeks. There was one major complication of intraspinal cement leakage during tumor vertebroplasty causing T5 root compression and requiring laminectomy for cement removal. The overall rate of major complications requiring treatment was 0.99 %.
Conclusion: 
Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty can be safely performed using only MSCT fluoroscopy guidance. The rate of major complications is very low. There was a high rate of small asymptomatic cement leakages which may have remained undetected with conventional fluoroscopy (CF). There was no statistically significant advantage for kyphoplasty with respect to cement leakage and the technical success rate.},

  abstract = {Purpose: 
To retrospectively evaluate complications of percutaneous vertebroplasty (PV) performed with polymethylmethacrylate cement to treat pain in patients with metastases to the spine.
Materials and methods: 
This study had institutional review board approval; patient informed consent for the review of records and images was not required. In 2 years, 117 patients (38 men [32.5%] and 79 women [67.5%]; mean age, 58.2 years) underwent 159 fluoroscopy-guided PV procedures to treat 304 vertebrae. Spinal metastases included osteolytic, osteoblastic, and mixed lesions. Complications were characterized as local or systemic. Evaluated data included immediate imaging findings (on radiographs and computed tomographic scans) and clinical findings at 30-day follow-up. Chi2 or Fisher exact testing was performed for univariate analysis of variables.
Results: 
The primary cancers were breast cancers (45.3%), lung cancers (14.5%), myeloma (7.7%), or other cancers (32.5%). Among the 423 cement leakages identified, 332 (78.5%) were vascular and 91 (21.5%) were nonvascular. Vascular leaks were classified as venous epidural leaks, paravertebral and foraminal plexus leaks, and leaks to the vena cava, while nonvascular leaks included puncture trajectory leaks, paravertebral soft tissue leaks, and diskal leaks. Patients with nonvascular leaks were asymptomatic. Eight (6.8%) patients experienced complications, and seven of these complications were symptomatic. Among these eight patients, six (5.1%) had local complications (puncture site hematoma in two patients and radicular pain [successfully treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids] in four patients), and two (1.7%) had systemic complications (pulmonary embolism resulting from cement migration through the vena cava). One of the latter patients died. Univariate analyses revealed a significant association between cement migration through the vena cava and pulmonary embolism (P = .001) but not between foraminal venous leakage and radicular pain (P = .123).
Conclusion: 
Despite numerous technical incidents (leaks), PV-induced complications were rare, leading to the hypothesis that systemic complications are a consequence of intravascular leakage while local complications are a consequence of cement-related irritation, compression and/or ischemia, and/or needle-induced trauma.},

  abstract = {Aim: 
The aim of this paper is to assess the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous vertebroplasty in patients with focal pain caused by compression vertebral body fractures.
Materials and methods: 
Over an eleven-month period 49 patients underwent percutaneous vertebroplasty, of which seven were retreated, for a total of 56 operations on 108 vertebrae. The patients were affected by osteoporotic compression fractures (n=28) or by benign and malignant infiltrative processes (n=21). All of the patients were examined at discharge and later at one week, and one, three, six and nine months after surgery to ascertain the development of the pain and possible changes in the quality of life. The mean length of follow-up was 3.8 months.
Results: 
One week after treatment all patients reported complete disappearance or significant alleviation of the pain. In 8 out of 49 patients (16.3%) there was a reoccurrence of pain; 7 of these patients underwent further treatment at another level with immediate pain relief. After surgery only three patients (6.1%) continued to take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), whereas prior to surgery all patients were taking pain medication. We also observed an important benefit in the quality of life, in that after treatment all patients reported an improvement in functional abilities, and only three (6.1%) still had to wear a back brace (against 15 in the preoperative period). We only had one serious complication (1.7%) which involved the formation of a subcutaneous paravertebral haematoma, which was resolved in about a week. Eight patients (16.3%) developed transient pain at the site of the puncture or radiculopathy in the days following the operation. In 63 out of 108 of the treated vertebrae (58) there were small asymptomatic leakages of cement outside the vertebral body and in two asymptomatic patients (3.5%) the chest radiograph revealed a small pulmonary embolism of cement.
Discussion: 
Our experience confirms the effectiveness of vertebroplasty in the treatment of pain caused by vertebral fractures. If the indications are respected the improvement of symptoms is often immediate, such as the return of mobility, and patient satisfaction with surgery is higher. The use of appropriate guiding systems limits the number of complications.},

  abstract = {Background context: 
The use of vertebroplasty for treatment of spinal fractures and spinal hemangiomas is increasing at a rapid pace. Although this is a minimally invasive procedure, complications have been reported. The most important of these is the unintentional migration of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA).
Purpose: 
The authors present methods, equipment, and principles that minimize occurrence of PMMA migration and other complications.
Study design::Setting: 
Patients in a private/university neurosurgery practice were studied retrospectively by chart review.
Patient sample: 
During a 3-year period, 53 levels of vertebroplasty were performed on 35 patients presenting with indications of intractable pain resulting from vertebral body compression fractures.
Outcome measures: 
Pain assessment and outcome determination were made by the treating physician based on dialog with the patient, examination, and the patient's use of narcotics. The medical records of patients were reviewed for these factors as well as for signs of cerebrospinal fluid leak, PMMA migration, new radiculopathy, myelopathy, new fracture, pulmonary emboli, infection, or bleeding.
Methods: 
Criteria for inclusion consisted of disabling back pain corresponding to a recent fracture, pharmacotherapy, and medically stable for anesthesia. Vertebroplasty patients were followed up at 2 to 3 weeks and at 3 months after their procedure.
Results: 
Success rate for relief of pain was 89%. The overall complication rate was 6% per treated vertebral level. There were no deaths or delayed complications. Factors that reduce complications were identified and include the following: accurate needle placement, adequate barium radio-opacification of PMMA, viscous low pressure delivery of PMMA, and PMMA delivery under direct fluoroscopic visualization.
Conclusion: 
Although vertebroplasty is considered a minimally invasive procedure, it can result in serious complications even without technical misadventures.},
